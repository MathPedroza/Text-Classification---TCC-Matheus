       "'Anti-tumor-promotion by principles obtained from Angelica keiskei. Potent anti-tumor promoter activity has been found in the nonpolar extracts of the root of Ashita-Ba, Angelica keiskei Koidz. (Umbelliferae), which is eaten as a vegetable in Japan. From this active fraction, two angular furanocoumarins, archangelicin (1), 8(S),9(R 9-angeloyloxy-8,9-dihydrooroselol (2), three linear furanocoumarins, psoralen (3), bergapten (4), xanthotoxin (5),, three chalcones, 4-hydroxyderricin (6), xanthoangelol (7), a novel chalcone named ashitaba-chalcone (8), were isolated. Among these compounds, two angular type furanocoumarins, 1, 2,, three chalcones, 6-8, suppressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA stimulated 32Pi-incorporation into phospholipids of cultured cells, whereas coumarins 3-5 were less effective. In addition, chalcones 6, 7 were proved to have anti-tumor-promoting activity in mouse skin carcinogenesis induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz a anthracene (DMBA) plus TPA. Since chalcones 6, 7 showed calmodulin-interacting property, both chalcones may reveal anti-tumor-promoting activity via the modulation of calmodulin involved systems. These chalcones may be useful to develop the effective method for cancer prevention.Effects of catechins on the mouse lung carcinoma cell adhesion to the endothelial cells. We studied the effects of 5 kinds of catechins on the adhesion of mouse lung carcinoma 3LL cells to the monolayer of bovine lung endothelial cells. (- Epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin-3-gallate were active in inhibiting the 3LL cell adhesion, while ( catechin, (- epicatechin were inactive. (- Epigallocatechin showed a considerable cytotoxicity. These data suggest that the specific chemical structure is required to exert the inhibitory activity of catechins, the search for the cellular binding protein(s) bound to these inhibitory catechins would provide a clue to clarify the mechanism of interactions between tumor cells, endothelial cells.Evaluation of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor for potential chemopreventive properties in colon cancer. Epidemiological, laboratory studies indicate an inverse relationship between the risk of colon cancer development, intake of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, including aspirin. One of the mechanisms by which nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents inhibit colon cancer is through the inhibition of prostaglandin production by cyclooxygenase isozymes (COX-1, COX-2). Overexpression of COX-2 has been observed in colon tumors. Thus, selective inhibitors of COX-2 could potentially serve as chemopreventive agents. We have assessed the chemopreventive properties of SC-58635, a COX-2 inhibitor,, of sulindac, as a positive control, in a double-blind study, using azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) as a measure of efficacy. Five-week-old male F344 rats were fed the control diet (modified AIN-76A) or experimental diets containing 150 or 1500 ppm SC-58635, 320 ppm sulindac, or 1500 ppm placebo. Two weeks later, all animals except those in vehicle (normal saline treated groups were s.c. injected with azoxymethane (15 mg kg of body weight, once weekly for 2 weeks). At 16 weeks of age, all rats were sacrificed, colons were evaluated for ACF. As expected, dietary administration of sulindac suppressed ACF development as such, reduced crypt multiplicity in terms of number of aberrant crypts focus. Administration of 1500 ppm SC-58635 inhibited total ACF induction, crypt multiplicity by about 40-49%. Our finding that SC-58635 significantly suppressed colonic ACF formation, crypt multiplicity strengthens the hypothesis that a selective COX-2 inhibitor possesses chemopreventive activity against colon cancer.Phase I study of E7010. E7010 is a novel sulfonamide which was discovered using slow-growing colon 38 carcinoma cells as a screening model. E7010 exhibits a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against human tumor xenografts. The mechanism of action is by arresting the progression of cells in M phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximum allowable dose (MAD), toxicity,, pharmacokinetics of single or 5-day repeated doses of E7010. In the single-dose study, E7010 was administered orally to 16 patients at doses ranging from 80 to 480 mg m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy at a dose of 480 mg m2. Hematological, gastrointestinal toxicities were mild. In the 5-day repeated-dose study, 41 patients were given E7010 at doses ranging from 30 to 240 mg m2 per day. The dose-limiting toxicities were peripheral neuropathy, intestinal paralysis. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-dependent but not severe. Hematological toxicity was not dose-dependent. Pharmacokinetic analysis in the single-dose study showed a rapid increase in the plasma levels of the drug after administration, followed by disappearance with a t1 2 of 4.4-16.6 h. The variation in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) between the patients was small, increased in a dose-dependent manner. Total drug recovery in urine 72 h after administration was 77.8 -11.4%, indicating that E7010 has favorable absorption, elimination profiles. The changes in the plasma levels of E7010 on day 5 in the 5-day repeated-dose study were almost the same as those on day 1, indicating that the drug did not accumulate. In the single-dose study, spinal cord metastasis exhibited a 74% reduction in a patient with uterine sarcoma, a minor response (MR) was observed in a pulmonary adenocarcinoma patient. In the 5-day repeated-dose study decreases in the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) were observed in a patient with stomach cancer, in a patient with recurrent uterine cervical carcinoma, respectively. The recommended phase II doses are 320 mg m2 for a single-dose study, 200 mg m2 per day for a 5-day repeated-dose study. Since the activity of E7010 is time-dependent, i.e. a certain concentration of E7010 is required for more than 12 h to suppress the growth of P388 leukemia cells, it is recommended that subsequent phase I II studies be conducted using a divided dose schedule in order to maintain the blood level of E7010.Studies on retinoids. IV. Design, synthesis, structure-activity relationships of di-t-butylphenyl compounds. Retinoic acid, its analogues play important roles in modulating cell growth, differentiation, immunity, apoptosis. Clinically they are used for cancer chemoprevention, chemotherapy. Based upon the moiety of 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxy phenyl ring, a series of substituted aromatic amide, ester, chalcones were designed, synthesized, which mimic the molecular shape, size,, spacial disposition of functional groups of retinoic acid. The general structure is as follows: formula: see text where R stands for hydrogen atom or methyl group, Y is the linkage -CONH-, -NHCO-, -COO-, -COCH = CH-, or a member of a heterocycle, X represents various substituents at different positions. The SAR indicates that the presence of hydrophobic group(s) at one end of the molecule,, a carboxyl group at the other end,, a conjugative system of molecule are necessary, full prerequisite for exhibiting activity. Loss of any one factor of them will abolish the activity. Being obligatory for anti-oxidative effect, the phenolic hydroxy group does not convey biological activity, because after methylation of the hydroxy group the compound increases the differentiation-inducing activity, loses the anti-oxidative effect, indicating that there is no correlation between the two activities. With a stable conformation of two phenyl rings with cis-conformation N-methylated acyl amide (No. 30) features in bent shape of the molecule, instead of an extended conformer, which is taken by the non-N-methylated partner, all-trans retinoic acid. A bent conformer of No. 30 accounts for the inactivity. In this paper compounds No. 4f, 4g, 5a, 7, 13, 32, 37,, 38 exhibited significant activity among them 4- 3-(3, 5-di-t-4-methoxyphenyl 3-oxo-1-propenyl benzoic acid (No. 38) showed high activity comparable to that of retinoic acid. The pharmacological action of No. 38 is under investigation.Genistein elicits pleiotropic molecular effects on head, neck cancer cells. Genistein (4,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone) has been reported to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis in different cancer cell lines in vitro, to show antitumor activity against a variety of tumors in animal models. We have previously reported that genistein induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis by up-regulating p21(WAF1), Bax,, down-regulating cyclin B1, Bcl-2 in a head, neck cancer cell line. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein elicits its effects on head, neck cancer cells still remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we report that genistein induces several specific molecular changes in head, neck cancer cells, such as down-regulation of c-erbB-2 expression, down-regulation of MMP-2, MMP-9 secretion, inhibition of tumor cell invasion, down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB DNA binding activity. In addition, genistein inhibited the levels of phosphorylated Akt, the expression of 14-3-3 protein. Moreover, genistein induces telomere shortening in treated cells without affecting telomerase activity in vitro. We also observed that genistein inhibits the translocation of telomerase catalytic subunit human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to the nucleus, which may result in telomere shortening, although the activity of telomerase is unaffected, along with the inhibition of metaphase spread of chromosomes. From these results, together with our previously published reports, we conclude that genistein elicits pleiotropic molecular changes that resulting in the inhibition of cell growth, the induction of apoptotic cell death of head, neck cancer cells, which suggests that genistein may be useful as a chemotherapeutic, or chemopreventive agent for head, neck cancer.Mechanism-based in vitro screening of potential cancer chemopreventive agents. Identification, use of effective cancer chemopreventive agents have become an important issue in public health-related research. For identification of potential cancer chemopreventive constituents we have set up a battery of cell-, enzyme-based in vitro marker systems relevant for prevention of carcinogenesis in vivo. These systems include modulation of drug metabolism (inhibition of Cyp1A activity, induction of NAD(P)H:quinone reductase (QR) activity in Hepa1c1c7 murine hepatoma cell culture), determination of radical scavenging (DPPH scavenging), antioxidant effects (scavenging of superoxide anion-, hydroxyl-, peroxyl-radicals), anti-inflammatory mechanisms (inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS mediated nitric oxide (NO) generation by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in Raw 264.7 murine macrophages, cyclooxygenase-1 (Cox-1) inhibition),, anti-tumor promoting activities (inhibition of phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in 308 murine keratinocytes). We have tested a series of known chemopreventive substances belonging to several structural classes as reference compounds for the identification of novel chemopreventive agents or mechanisms. These include organosulfur compounds (phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), diallylsulfide, diallyldisulfide), terpenes (limonene, perillyl alcohol, oleanolic acid, 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid), short-chain fatty acids (sodium butyrate), indoles (indole-3-carbinol), isoflavonoids (quercetin, silymarin, genistein), catechins (epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)), simple phenols (ellagic acid, resveratrol, piceatannol, curcumin), pharmaceutical agents (piroxicam, acetylsalicylic acid, tamoxifen),, vitamins derivatives (ascorbic acid, Trolox). We confirmed known chemopreventive mechanisms of these compounds. Additionally, we could demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by identification of hitherto unknown mechanisms of selected agents. As an example, we detected anti-inflammatory properties of PEITC, based on NF-kappaB-mediated inhibition of NO production. Further, PEITC inhibited phorbol ester-induced superoxide anion radical production in granulocytes,, ODC induction in the 308 cell line. These mechanisms might contribute to the chemopreventive potential of PEITC.Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits activation of HER-2 neu, downstream signaling pathways in human head, neck, breast carcinoma cells. Overexpression of the HER-2 neu receptor (HER-2) is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast carcinoma, also in patients with head, neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In a previous study on HNSCC cell lines, we found that epigalocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major biologically active component of green tea, inhibited activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thereby inhibited EGFR-related downstream signaling pathways in HNSCC cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of EGCG on activation of the HER-2 receptor in human HNSCC, breast carcinoma cell lines that display constitutive activation of HER-2. Treatment of these cells with 10 or 30 microg of EGCG, respectively, doses that cause 50% inhibition of growth, markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of HER-2 in both cell lines. This was associated with inhibition of Stat3 activation, inhibition of c-fos, cyclin D1 promoter activity,, decreased cellular levels of the cyclin D1, Bcl-XL proteins. Although these concentrations of EGCG are quite high, we found that concentrations of 0.1-1.0 microg ml, which are in the range of plasma concentrations after administering a single oral dose of EGCG or a green tea extract, markedly enhanced the sensitivity of both types of cell lines to growth inhibition by Taxol, a drug frequently used in the treatment of breast carcinoma, HNSCC. These results, taken together with previous evidence that EGCG also inhibits activation of the EGFR in carcinoma cells, suggest that EGCG may be useful in treating cases of breast carcinoma, HNSCC in which activation of the EGFR, or HER-2 plays important roles in tumor survival, growth.Xenoestrogen-induced ERK-1, ERK-2 activation via multiple membrane-initiated signaling pathways. Xenoestrogens can mimic or antagonize the activity of physiological estrogens,, the suggested mechanism of xenoestrogen action involves binding to esr1s (ERs). However, the failure of various in vitro or in vivo assays to show strong genomic activity of xenoestrogens compared with estradiol (E2) makes it difficult to explain their ability to cause abnormalities in animal (and perhaps human) reproductive functions via this pathway of steroid action. E2 has also been shown to initiate rapid intracellular signaling, such as changes in levels of intracellular calcium, cAMP,, nitric oxide,, activations of a variety of kinases, via action at the membrane. In this study, we demonstrate that several xenoestrogens can rapidly activate extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) in the pituitary tumor cell line GH3 B6 F10, which expresses high levels of the membrane receptor for ER-alpha (mER). We tested a phytoestrogen (coumestrol), organochlorine pesticides or their metabolites (endosulfan, dieldrin,, DDE),, detergent by-products of plastics manufacturing (p-nonylphenol, bisphenol A). These xenoestrogens (except bisphenolA) produced rapid (3-30 min after application), concentration (10(-14 10(-8) M dependent ERK-1 2 phosphorylation but with distinctly different activation patterns. To identify signaling pathways involved in ERK activation, we used specific inhibitors of ERs, epidermal growth factor receptors, Ca2 signaling, Src, phosphoinositide-3 kinases,, a membrane structure disruption agent. Multiple inhibitors blocked ERK activation, suggesting simultaneous use of multiple pathways, complex signaling web interactions. However, inhibitors differentially affected each xenoestrogen response examined. These actions may help to explain the distinct abilities of xenoestrogens to disrupt reproductive functions at low concentrations.Effects of phenolics in Empire apples on hydrogen peroxide-induced inhibition of gap-junctional intercellular communication. The present study investigated antioxidant, antitumor-promoting activities of major phenolic phytochemicals of apples. The contents of each antioxidant in Empire apples was quantified, their contributions to total antioxidant activity of apples were determined using assay for inhibition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced superoxide radical generation in cell culture model, expressed in vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). The estimated contribution of major phenolics, vitamin C to total anitoxidant capacity of 100 g fresh Empire apples is as follows: quercetin (60.05 VCEAC) > chlorogenic acid (12.32) > phloretin (7.41) > procyanidin B2 (7.22) > vitamin C (6.61) > epicatechin (5.10) in superoxide radical scavenging assay. Recent reports suggest that the mechanism of carcinogenic process of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may be associated with the inhibition of gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), which is involved in tumor promotion process. Apple extracts showed the protective effects against the inhibition of GJIC by H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner. Quercetin exerted the strongest protective effects among major antioxidants in apples on H2O2-induced inhibition of GJIC, following epicatechin, procyanidin B2,, vitamin C, while chlorogenic acid, phloretin had no effects. Our results indicate that cancer chemopreventive activity of apples is associated with the combined antioxidant capacity, antitumor-promoting activities of diverse antioxidants.Low-dose dietary phytoestrogen abrogates tamoxifen-associated mammary tumor prevention. Wild-type erbB-2 neu transgenic mice were used to study the interactions between tamoxifen, dietary phytoestrogens (or isoflavones) by dose, form in vivo. Mice were randomized to one of four dietary formulas, implanted with an 8-week continuous-release tamoxifen or placebo pellet at 8 weeks of age. In placebo-treated mice, soy meal diet (but not diets supplemented with low-dose or high-dose isoflavones or a casein diet) resulted in prolongation of tumor latency. In tamoxifen-treated mice fed the soy meal, casein, or high-dose isoflavone enriched diets, the majority (>80%) showed no tumor formation by 60 weeks of age. Of the mice that developed tumors, latency was significantly prolonged. In tamoxifen-treated mice fed the low-dose isoflavone enriched diet, a much higher rate of mammary tumor development (>50% P < 0.002), a shorter tumor latency were observed. In vitro studies of human, mouse mammary tumor cell lines confirm that low doses of genistein, co-administered with tamoxifen, promote cell proliferation. This is in contrast to tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen with higher doses of genistein that are growth inhibitory. In summary, low-dose dietary isoflavones abrogated tamoxifen-associated mammary tumor prevention in vivo. These interactions are supported by in vitro data from human, mouse mammary tumor cell lines. These dose-associated interactions likely have relevance to the human use of tamoxifen for prevention or treatment of breast cancer.New anticancer agents: in vitro, in vivo evaluation of the antitumor, antimetastatic actions of various compounds isolated from medicinal plants. In this review, in the search for the development of new anticancer drugs, the effects of compounds isolated from various medicinal plants on tumor growth, metastasis, using mice bearing a highly metastatic drug-resistant mouse tumor, were studied. The antitumor, antimetastatic actions of stilbene derivatives isolated from Polygonum, Cassia species were examined. Among the stilbene derivatives, resveratrol, cassiagrol A (stilbene dimer) displayed antitumor, antimetastatic actions through the inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization in in vitro, in vivo models. It was found that two chalcone derivatives from Angelica keiskei roots also inhibited tumor growth, metastasis in tumor-bearing mice through the inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization, or the inhibition of immune suppression caused by tumors. Recently, basidiomycete fungi have been used for the treatment of cancer. Then, the low molecular weight substances were isolated from Agaricus blazei, Ganoderma lucidum as antitumor, antimetastatic substances. It is suggested that these substances of basidiomycete also inhibited tumor growth, metastasis to the lung through the inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization, or the inhibition of immune suppression caused by tumors.Celecoxib could reverse the hypoxia-induced Angiopoietin-2 upregulation in gastric cancer. We investigated the potential effect of Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) on hypoxia-induced Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) expression in gastric cancer cells. Our results revealed that hypoxia augmented Cox-2 , Ang-2 expressions. Also, the hypoxia-induced Ang-2 could be mimicked by CoCl(2) treatment while genestein treatment could partially counteract the hypoxia-induced Ang-2 expression. Celecoxib but not Cox-1 inhibitor sc-560 reversed the hypoxia-induced Ang-2 expression, while this effect could be partially restored by addition of exogenous PGE2. Our findings suggest that the hypoxia-elevated Ang-2 expression in gastric cancer cells may be mediated by both Cox-2-derived PGE2 , HIF-1alpha pathways, while celecoxib could counteract the hypoxia-induced Ang-2 expression.Prostate cancer has the third highest incidence of all cancers in men worldwide with incidence and mortality being particularly high in affluent, developed countries. Tea, especially green tea, has demonstrated promise in the prevention of several cancers. Green tea contains several components including catechins, a category of polyphenols that have chemopreventive properties. Although evidence from epidemiological studies is not comprehensive, it is strengthened by animal and in vitro evidence suggesting that consumption of tea is associated with decreased risk or progression of prostate cancer. Emerging evidence and potential biological mechanisms for the role of green tea in prostate cancer prevention are presented in this review.Combined inhibitory effects of green tea polyphenols, selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors on the growth of human prostate cancer cells both in vitro, in vivo. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors hold promise for cancer chemoprevention however, recent toxicity concerns suggest that new strategies are needed. One approach to overcome this limitation is to use lower doses of COX-2 inhibitors in combination with other established agents with complementary mechanisms. In this study, the effect of (-)epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a promising chemopreventive agent from green tea, was tested alone, in combination with specific COX-2 inhibitors on the growth of human prostate cancer cells both in vitro, in vivo. Human prostate cancer cells LNCaP, PC-3,, CWR22Rnu1 were treated with EGCG, NS398 alone, in combination,, their effect on growth, apoptosis was evaluated. In vivo, athymic nude mice implanted with androgen-sensitive CWR22Rnu1 cells were given green tea polyphenols (0.1% in drinking water), celecoxib (5 mg kg, i.p., daily, 5 days per week), alone, in combination,, their effect on tumor growth was evaluated. Combination of EGCG (10-40 micromol L), NS-398 (10 micromol L) resulted in enhanced (a) cell growth inhibition (b) apoptosis induction (c) expression of Bax, pro-caspase-6,, pro-caspase-9,, poly(ADP)ribose polymerase cleavage (d) inhibition of pparg, (e) inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB compared with the additive effects of the two agents alone, suggesting a possible synergism. In vivo, combination treatment with green tea polyphenols, celecoxib resulted in enhanced (a) tumor growth inhibition, (b) lowering of prostate-specific antigen levels, (c) lowering of insulin-like growth factor-I levels,, (d) circulating levels of serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 compared with results of single-agent treatment. These data suggest synergistic, or additive effects of combinatorial chemopreventive agents, underscore the need for rational design of human clinical trials.Combretastatin-chalcone hybrids: synthesis, cytotoxicity. A series of all-trans-1-aryl-4-aryl-5-aryl-2,4-pentanediene-1-one (3), a hybridized form of chalcone, combretastatin, was synthesized, evaluated against a panel of cancer cell lines, including B16, murine melanoma HCT116, colon cancer A431, human epidermoid carcinoma, human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC). Structure-activity relationships analysis of this series revealed that a 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl at position 1 of the 2,4-pentanediene-1-one was essential for cytotoxicity. all-trans-1-(2,5-Dihydroxyphenyl 5-(4-methoxyphenyl 4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl 2,4-pentanediene-1-one (3a) was the most potent compound from this series.Effects of acetylsalicylic acid , celecoxib on the N-nitrosodiethylamine induced carcinogenesis in rat liver , esophagus. The effects of nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (acetylsalicylic acid , celecoxib) on N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced carcinogenesis in the liver , esophagus were studied in rats. The inhibitory effect of celecoxib on carcinogenesis was more pronounced (in comparison with acetylsalicylic acid), which manifested in a significantly decreased incidence of neoplastic changes in the liver tissue (from 91.7 to 65.2%), number of tumors in the esophagus (from 4.13 to 2.61 tumor rat), , in delayed malignization in the liver , esophagus. The incidence of erosions , ulcers of the gastric mucosa was significantly lower after celecoxib treatment. These data indicate that celecoxib inhibits N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced carcinogenesis in the liver , esophagus.Comparative evaluation of antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, apoptosis inducing potential of black tea polyphenols in the hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis model. To evaluate the relative chemopreventive efficacy of two black tea polyphenols, Polyphenon-B P-B , BTF-35 on 7,12-dimethylbenz a anthracene (DMBA induced hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcinogenesis. Hamsters were divided into 6 groups. The right buccal pouches of animals in groups 1-3 were painted with 0.5% of DMBA three times a week for 14 weeks. While hamsters in group 1 received no further treatment, animals in groups 2, 3 received diet containing 0.05% P-B, BTF-35 respectively, four weeks before DMBA painting that was continued until the end of the experiments. Animals in groups 4, 5 were given P-B, BTF-35 alone respectively as in groups 2, 3. Group 6 animals served as the untreated control. All the animals were sacrificed aftesr18 weeks. The expression of p21, cyclin D1, glutathione S-transferase pi (GST-P), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cytokeratins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was analysed by RT-PCR, immunohistochemical, Western blot analyses. DMBA treated animals developed buccal pouch carcinomas that displayed increased expression of p21, cyclin D1, GST-P, NF-kappaB, cytokeratins, VEGF, Bcl-2 with decreased expression of Bax, cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9,, PARP. Dietary administration of both P-B, BTF-35 reduced the incidence of DMBA-induced HBP carcinomas by modulating markers of cell proliferation, cell survival, tumor infiltration, angiogenesis,, apoptosis. The results of the present study provide a mechanistic basis for the chemopreventive potential of black tea polyphenols. The greater efficacy of BTF-35 in inhibiting HBP carcinogenesis, modulating multiple molecular targets may have a potential role in the prevention of oral cancer.Colorectal cancer is the most abundant cause of cancer mortality in the Western world. Nutrition and the microbial flora are considered to have a marked influence on the risk of colorectal cancer, the formation of butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) possibly playing a major role as chemopreventive products of microbial fermentation in the colon. In this study, we investigated the effects of butyrate, other SCFAs, and of a number of phenolic SCFA and trans-cinnamic acid derivatives formed during the intestinal degradation of polyphenolic constituents of fruits and vegetables on global histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in nuclear extracts from colon carcinoma cell cultures using tert-butoxycarbonyl-lysine (acetylated)-4-amino-7-methylcoumarin (Boc-Lys(Ac)-AMC) as substrate. Inhibition of HDAC activity, e.g., by butyrate, is related to a suppression of malignant transformation and a stimulation of apoptosis of precancerous colonic cells. In nuclear extracts from HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells, butyrate was found to be the most potent HDAC inhibitor (IC50=0.09 mM). In the same assay, p-coumaric acid (IC50=0.19 mM), 3-(4-OH-phenyl)-propionate (IC50=0.62 mM) and caffeic acid (IC50=0.85 mM) were the most potent HDAC inhibitors among the polyphenol metabolites tested. Interestingly, butyrate was also the most potent HDAC inhibitor in a whole-cell HeLa Mad 38-based reporter gene assay. The findings suggest that butyrate plays an outstanding role as endogenous HDAC inhibitor in the colon.Xenoestrogens modulate vascular endothelial growth factor secretion in breast cancer cells through an esr1-dependent mechanism. Environmental chemicals may affect human health by disrupting endocrine function. Their possible role in the mammary gland, breast tumors is still unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key factor in angiogenesis, tumor progression, is an estrogen-regulated gene. We analyzed whether VEGF expression is regulated by different xenoestrogens in several breast cancer cells, MELN (derived from MCF-7), MELP (derived from MDA-MB-231), stably expressing esr1 (ERalpha) these cell lines stably express estrogen response element (beta-globin luciferase. Genistein, bisphenol A (BPA), 4-(tert-octyl)phenol (OP), dieldrin,, several phthalates, including benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), di-ethyl-2-hexyle phthalate (DEHP), were first shown to be estrogenic. These compounds induced a dose-dependent increase of VEGF secretion in MELN, MCF-7 cells maximal effect was observed at 1-10 microM non-cytotoxic concentrations, was inhibited by the antiestrogen ICI 182 780. VEGF increase was not observed in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Most substances increased VEGF transcript levels in MELN cells. In contrast, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, vinclozolin,, the phthalates (mono-n-butyl ester phthalic acid, di-isononyle phthalate,, di-isodecyle phthalate) were ineffective on both VEGF secretion, estrogenic luciferase induction in these cell lines. Specific kinase inhibitors PD98059, SB203580, or LY294002 suppressed the xenoestrogen-induced VEGF response, suggesting activation of MEK, p38 kinase,, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathways. Our in vitro results show for the first time that genistein, xenoestrogens (BPA, OP, dieldrin, BBP,, DEHP at high concentrations) up-regulate VEGF expression in MELN cells by an ER-dependent mechanism. Since VEGF increases capillary permeability, breast tumor angiogenesis in vivo, the physiological relevance of these findings is discussed.Geraniin-mediated apoptosis by cleavage of focal adhesion kinase through up-regulation of Fas ligand expression in human melanoma cells. Geraniin, a form of tannin separated from geranium, causes cell death through induction of apoptosis however, cell death characteristics for geraniin have not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigated the mechanism of geraniin-induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells, demonstrated that geraniin was able to induce cell apoptosis in a concentration-, time-dependent manner. We also examined the signaling pathway related to geraniin-induced apoptosis. To clarify the relationship between focal adhesion kinase (FAK), geraniin-induced apoptosis, we treated human melanoma cells with geraniin, found that this resulted dose-, time-dependent degradation in FAK. However, FAK cleavage was significantly inhibited when cells were pretreated with a selective inhibitor of caspase-3 (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO). Here, we demonstrated for the first time that geraniin triggered cell death by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of FAK. There were two possible mechanisms for activating caspase-3, mitochondria-mediated, receptor-mediated apoptosis. To confirm the geraniin-relevant signaling pathway, using immunoblot analysis we found that geraniin-induced apoptosis was associated with the up-regulation of Fas ligand expression, the activation of caspase-8, the cleavage of Bid,, the induction of cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol. Treatment with geraniin caused induction of caspase-3 activity in a dose-, time-dependent manner followed by proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase,, DNA fragmentation factor 45. The geraniin-induced apoptosis may provide a pivotal mechanism for its cancer-chemopreventive action.Epoxyquinol B shows antiangiogenic, antitumor effects by inhibiting VEGFR2, EGFR, FGFR,, PDGFR. Angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels to provide oxygen, nutrients, is indispensable for solid tumor growth. Therefore, the inhibition of angiogenesis is an important modality for cancer chemotherapy. Here we report the antiangiogenic mechanism, antitumor effects of epoxyquinol B (EPQB), which was isolated from fungal metabolites. Short-term treatment of EPQB resulted in the reduction of tumor growth, the number of blood vessels directed to the tumor in a murine xenografts model. Furthermore, EPQB inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF induced migration, tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) without cytotoxicity. VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), phospholipase Cgamma-1 (PLCgamma1),, p44 42 MAP kinases (ERK) was inhibited by EPQB in a dose-dependent manner,, in vitro assay using kinase domain of VEGFR2 showed that EPQB covalently bound, inhibited the VEGFR2 kinase. Its binding site on VEGFR2 was different from SU5614, a well-known VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, EPQB inhibited growth factor-induced activation of not only VEGFR2 but also epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), suggesting that EPQB is a novel multiple kinase inhibitor. These findings suggest that EPQB would be a good lead compound for the development of potent antiangiogenic, antitumor drugs.Pretreatment with black tea polyphenols modulates xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in an experimental oral carcinogenesis model. The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of the black tea polyphenols Polyphenon-B, BTF-35 during the preinitiation phase of 7,12-dimethylbenz a anthracene (DMBA induced hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcinogenesis. Hamsters were divided into six groups. Animals in groups 2, 3 received diet containing Polyphenon-B, BTF-35, respectively, 4 weeks before carcinogen administration when they were 6 weeks of age, continued until the final exposure to carcinogen. At 10 weeks of age, animals in groups 1, 2,, 3 were painted with 0.5% DMBA three times a week for 14 weeks. Animals in groups 4, 5 were given Polyphenon-B, BTF-35 alone, respectively, as in groups 2, 3. Animals in group 6 served as control. All the animals were sacrificed after an experimental period of 18 weeks. Phase I, phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in the buccal pouch, liver were used as biomarkers of chemoprevention. Hamsters painted with DMBA showed increased expression of 8-OH-dG, enhanced activities of phase I (CYP450 total as well as CYP1A1, 1A2,, 2B isoforms, cytochrome b5), phase II (GST, quinone reductase) xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes with increased immunohistochemical expression of CYP1A1,, CYP1B1 isoforms in the buccal pouch. This was accompanied by increased phase I, decreased phase II enzyme activities in the liver. Administration of Polyphenon-B, BTF-35 significantly decreased tumor incidence, oxidative DNA damage, phase I enzyme activities as well as expression of CYP1A1, CYP1B1 isoforms, while enhancing phase II enzyme activities in the buccal pouch, liver. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for the chemopreventive potential of black tea polyphenols. Furthermore, the greater efficacy of BTF-35 in chemoprevention of HBP carcinomas via inhibition of oxidative DNA damage, modulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes may have a major impact in human oral cancer prevention.Mitochondria, PPARs,, Cancer: Is Receptor-Independent Action of PPAR Agonists a Key? Before the discovery of ppars (PPARs), it was well known that certain drugs considered as classical PPAR-alpha agonists induced hepatocarcinoma or peroxisome proliferation in rodents. These drugs were derivatives of fibric acid,, they included clofibrate, bezafibrate,, fenofibrate. However, such toxicity has never been observed in human patients treated with these hypolipidemic drugs. Thiazolidinediones are a new class of PPAR activators showing greater specificity for the gamma isoform of PPARs. These drugs are used as insulin sensitizers in the treatment of type II diabetes. In addition, they have been shown to induce cell differentiation or apoptosis in various experimental models of cancer. PPAR-alpha ligands have also been shown to induce cancer cell differentiation and, paradoxically, PPAR-gamma drug activators have been reported to act as carcinogens. The confusing picture that emerges from these data is further complicated by the series of intriguing side effects observed following administration of pharmacological PPAR ligands (rhabdomyolysis, liver, heart toxicity, anemia, leucopenia). These side effects cannot be easily explained by simple interactions between the drug, nuclear receptors. Rather, these side effects seem to indicate that the ligands have biological activity independent of the nuclear receptors. Considering the emerging role of mitochondria in cancer, the potential metabolic connections between this organelle, PPAR physiology, characterization of the reciprocal influences is fundamental not only for a better understanding of cancer biology, but also for more defined pharmacotoxicological profiles of drugs that modulate PPARs.Analyzing anti-cancer action mechanisms of dihydroartemisinin using gene chip. To understand the action mechanisms of artesunate on inhibiting leukaemia cell line K562 on the molecular level. The gene chip was used to detect the expression panel of genes of leukaemia cell line K562 treated by dihydroartemisinin. K562 cells were treated with 1 x 10(-5), 4 x 10(-5), 16 x 10(-5), 64 x 10(-5), 256 x 10(-5) mol x L dihydroartemisinin for 24 h,, then studied the modality changes by invert microscope. The morphological changes of the nucleons were observed by Hoechst33342 PI staining. The cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry analysis (FCM). Total RNA samples were obtained by TRIzol, were reverse transcribed to the cDNA. The cDNA samples were hybridized to our gene chips. Hybridization signal were collected, analyzed following scanning by Gene Pix 4100A. The numbers of drift cells were increased, the density of cells was decreased under invert microscope after K562 cells were treated with dihydroartemisinin for 24 h. Morphological changes of cell apoptosis such as karyopyknosis, conglomeration were observed by Hoechst 33342 PI staining. Flow cytometric analysis showed that cells were arrested in G2 phase. There were 13 differentially expressed genes identified. Hybridization analysis showed up-regulation of chk1, down-regulation of PCNA, cyclinB1, cyclinD1, cyclinE1, cdk4, cdk2, E2F1, DNA-PK, DNA-Topo I, mcl-1, jNK, VEGF in the dihydroartemisinin-treated K562 cells. Dihydroartemisinin can Inhibit the leukaemia cell line K562, exert its anti-cancer effect by altering the expression of these genes involved in cell cycle dihydroartemisinin may act via apoptosis pathway.Marine phosphatidylcholine suppresses 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colon cancer in rats by inducing apoptosis. In vitro, animal studies indicate that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) suppress carcinogenesis. This study presents a new insight on effectiveness of marine phospholipids for suppression of colon cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate growth inhibition, apoptosis inducing effects of n-3 PUFA in the form of marine phosphatidylcholine (PC) on chemically induced (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) colon cancer in rats. Growth inhibition of Caco-2 cells was determined by colorimetric sodium 2-(4-iodophenyl 3-(4-nitrophenyl 5-(2,4-disulfophenyl 2H-tetrazolium (WST-1) dye reduction assay. For animal studies, the rats were fed 5 different diets containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA ethyl ester, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA ethyl ester, squid meal PC (rich in DHA), starfish PC (rich in EPA),, corn oil. The 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (30 mg kg) or saline was injected 48 hours before the experiment. Rats were anesthetized,, apoptotic as well as mitotic cells in crypt were counted based on morphological criteria in isolated crypts. Squid meal, starfish PC potently inhibited the growth of Caco-2 cells. The experimental diets containing n-3 PUFA suppressed colon cancer in rats. Rats that consumed diets containing DHA-ethyl ester, EPA-ethyl ester, squid meal PC,, starfish PC showed increased apoptosis (P < .01), suppressed proliferation. These results suggest that marine PC-containing diets might be an effective dietary protective factor against colon cancer.Transcription factor TFII-I causes transcriptional upregulation of GRP78 synthesis in prostate cancer cells. Receptor-recognized forms of alpha(2 macroglobulin (alpha(2)M*) bind to cell surface-associated GRP78, induce proliferative, survival signaling in prostate cancer cells. As part of the cellular response to alpha(2)M*, GRP78 expression is itself upregulated. In response to other stimuli, the transcription factor TFII-I upregulates GRP78 by binding to its gene promoter. We have, therefore, studied the role of TFII-I in transcriptional upregulation of GRP78 in 1-LN human prostate cancer cells stimulated with alpha(2)M*. This treatment caused a two- to threefold increase in TFII-I, GRP78 synthesis from (35)S -labeled precursor amino acids. Synthesis of both TFII-I, GRP78 were significantly reduced by silencing TFII-I gene expression or pretreatment of cells with genistein or actinomycin D. Confocal microscopy was employed to demonstrate relocation of TFII-I to the nucleus. In alpha(2)M*-stimulated cells, moreover, TFII-I bound to the GRP78 promoter as determined by CHIP assay. We also demonstrate binding of TFII-I to the c-fos promoter, consistent with its role in upregulating c-fos gene expression. In non-lymphoid cells, phosphorylated c-Src is an activator of TFII-I. Ligation of GRP78 on 1-LN cells with alpha(2)M* was followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src as well as TFII-I. We conclude that alpha(2)M*-induced increase in GRP78 synthesis is caused by transcriptional upregulation of TFII-I which binds to the GRP78 promoter, thus potentiates its cell survival, antipoptotic functions in 1-LN prostate cancer cells.Vitisin A suppresses LPS-induced NO production by inhibiting ERK, p38,, NF-kappaB activation in RAW 264.7 cells. Vitisin A, a resveratrol tetramer isolated from Vitis vinifera roots, exhibits antioxidative, anticancer, antiapoptotic,, anti-inflammatory effects. It also inhibits nitric oxide (NO) production. Here, we examined the mechanism by which vitisin A inhibits NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Vitisin A dose dependently inhibited LPS-induced NO production, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression. In contrast, the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not altered by vitisin A. To investigate the signaling pathway for NO inhibition by vitisin A, we examined nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, an inflammation-induced signal pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. Vitisin A inhibited LPS-induced erk1 , erk2 (ERK1 2), p38 phosphorylation, suppressed LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in RAW 264.7 cells. This suggests that vitisin A decreased NO production via downregulation of ERK1 2, p38, the NF-kappaB signal pathway in RAW 264.7 cells.Syntheses, potential anti-prostate cancer activities of ionone-based chalcones. We report the SAR studies of 43 ionone-based chalcones that demonstrate substantial in vitro anti-proliferative activities in LNCaP, MDA-PCa-2b, 22Rv1, C4-2B, PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. Compound 25 with an IC(50) value of 0.74 microM in LNCaP cells potently antagonizes DHT-induced transactivation of the wild type, the clinically relevant T877A, W741C, H874Y mutated androgen receptors, representing a novel chalcone as pan-antagonist of androgen receptor.Epigallocatechin gallate suppresses azoxymethane-induced colonic premalignant lesions in male C57BL KsJ-db db mice. Obesity, diabetes mellitus are risk factors for colon cancer. The activation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) IGF-IR axis plays a critical role in this carcinogenesis. (- Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major constituent of green tea, seems to have both antiobesity, antidiabetic effects. This study examined the effects of EGCG on the development of azoxymethane-induced colonic premalignant lesions in C57BL KsJ-db db (db db) mice, which are obese, develop diabetes mellitus. Male db db mice were given four weekly s.c. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg kg body weight), then they received drinking water containing 0.01% or 0.1% EGCG for 7 weeks. At sacrifice, drinking water with EGCG caused a significant decrease in the number of total aberrant crypt foci, large aberrant crypt foci,, beta-catenin accumulated crypts in these mice, all of which are premalignant lesions of the colon. The colonic mucosa of db db mice expressed high levels of the IGF-IR, phosphorylated form of IGF-IR (p-IGF-IR), p-GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, cyclooxygenase-2,, cyclin D1 proteins,, EGCG in drinking water caused a marked decrease in the expression of these proteins. Treating these mice with EGCG also caused an increase in the serum level of IGFBP-3 while conversely decreasing the serum levels of IGF-I, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol,, leptin. EGCG overcomes the activation of the IGF IGF-IR axis, thereby inhibiting the development of colonic premalignant lesions in an obesity-related colon cancer model, which was also associated with hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia,, hyperleptinemia. EGCG may be, therefore, useful in the chemoprevention or treatment of obesity-related colorectal cancer.Synthesis, biological evaluation of 3\\',4\\',5\\'-trimethoxychalcone analogues as inhibitors of nitric oxide production, tumor cell proliferation. A series of 23 3\\',4\\',5\\'-trimethoxychalcone analogues was synthesized, their inhibitory effects on nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS IFN-gamma-treated macrophages,, tumor cell proliferation has been investigated. 4-Hydroxy-3,3\\',4\\',5\\'-tetramethoxychalcone (7), 3,4-dihydroxy-3\\',4\\',5\\'-trimethoxychalcone (11), 3-hydroxy-3\\',4,4\\',5\\'-tetramethoxychalcone (14),, 3,3\\',4\\',5\\'-tetramethoxychalcone (15) were the most potent growth inhibitory agents on NO production, with an IC(50) value of 0.3, 1.5, 1.3, 0.3 microM, respectively. The tumor cells proliferation assay results revealed that several compounds exhibited potent inhibition activity against different cancer cell lines. The chalcone 15 was the most potent anti-proliferative compound in the series with IC(50) values of 1.8, 2.2 microM toward liver cancer Hep G2, colon cancer Colon 205 cell lines, respectively. 2,3,3\\',4\\',5\\'-Pentamethoxychalcone (1), 3,3\\',4,4\\',5,5\\'-hexamethoxychalcone (3), 2,3\\',4,4\\',5,5\\'-hexamethoxychalcone (5), 2-hydroxy-3,3\\',4\\',5\\'-tetramethoxychalcone (10), 11, 14 showed significant anti-proliferation actions in Hep G2, Colon 205 cells with an IC(50) values ranging between 10, 20 microM. Among the tested agents, compound 7 showed selective NO production inhibition (IC(50)=0.3 microM), while has no effect on tumor cell proliferation (IC(50) >100 microM). 3,3\\',4,4\\',5\\'-Pentamethoxychalcone (2) showed selective anti-proliferation effect in Hep G2 cells, in addition to its potent NO inhibition, however has no such response in Colon 205 cells. In contrast, 3-formyl-3\\',4\\',5\\'-trimethoxychalcone (22) showed moderate growth inhibition in Colon 205 cells, while has no such effect on NO production, Hep G2 cells proliferation. These results provide insight into the correlation between some structural properties of 3\\',4\\',5\\'-trimethoxychalcones, their in vitro anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer differentiation activity.Capsaicin displays anti-proliferative activity against human small cell lung cancer in cell culture, nude mice models via the E2F pathway. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by rapid progression, low survival rates. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed for this disease. Capsaicin, the active ingredient of chilli peppers, displays anti-proliferative activity in prostate, epidermoid cancer in vitro. However, the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin has not been studied in human SCLCs. The present manuscript fills this void of knowledge, explores the anti-proliferative effect of capsaicin in SCLC in vitro, in vivo. BrdU assays, PCNA ELISAs showed that capsaicin displays robust anti-proliferative activity in four human SCLC cell lines. Furthermore, capsaicin potently suppressed the growth of H69 human SCLC tumors in vivo as ascertained by CAM assays, nude mice models. The second part of our study attempted to provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin. We found that the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin is correlated with a decrease in the expression of E2F-responsive proliferative genes like cyclin E, thymidylate synthase, cdc25A, cdc6, both at mRNA, protein levels. The transcription factor E2F4 mediated the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin. Ablation of E2F4 levels by siRNA methodology suppressed capsaicin-induced G1 arrest. ChIP assays demonstrated that capsaicin caused the recruitment of E2F4, p130 on E2F-responsive proliferative promoters, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of capsaicin could be useful in the therapy of human SCLCs.Reversal of multidrug resitance by natural substances from plants. The multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins that belong to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MRP1, are present in a majority of human tumors, constitute an important cause of therapeutic failure. Selective inhibitors of the MDR-efflux proteins may improve the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy. Their mechanism of action was believed to be a competition between resistance modifiers, drugs for the same binding site of P-gp. In our previous work we studied modulation of MDR in cancer cells expressing P-gp or MRP1 by selected carotenoids, flavonoids, extracts from medically important Chinese plants. Capsanthin, capsorubin, carotenoids isolated from paprika, were identified as potent P-gp inhibitors, while lycopene, lutein, antheraxanthin, violaxanthin induced moderate effects. Among flavonoids, effective modulators were rotenone, chrysin, phloretin, sakuranetin. Some chloroform extracts of Chinese herbs were also found to inhibit MDR efflux pumps. The effects of the modulators on P-gp activity were studied by measuring rhodamine 123 uptake in several cancer cells such as the human MDR1 gene-transfected mouse lymphoma cells (L1210), human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 expressing the MRP1 pump (HTB26). Additionally, the ability to alter biophysical properties of lipid bilayers by selected carotenoids was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The antiproliferative effects as well as the MDR reversal activity of the studied compounds, applied in combination with anticancer drugs, were also discussed.Icariin derivative inhibits inflammation through suppression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. In this study we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of an icariin derivative (3,5-dihydroxy-4\\'-methoxy-6\\'\\',6\\'\\'-dimethy1-4\\'\\',5\\'\\'-dihydropyrano 2\\'\\',3\\'\\':7,8 -flavone). We found that this icariin derivative inhibits tnf (TNF-alpha) production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression,, protein expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. It also alleviates paw edema induced by carrageenan in mice. To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying these anti-inflammatory effects, we examined the effects of this compound on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylation of inhibitory kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha),, nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF kappaB,, found it suppresses the activation of p38 MAPK, inhibits translocation of NF-kappaB p65 to the nucleus through decreasing the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. As a result of these properties, this icariin derivative can be considered as a potential drug for inflammatory diseases.Chalcones, dihydrochalcones augment TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Chalcones, dihydrochalcones exhibit chemopreventive, antitumor activity. TRAIL (tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a natural endogenous anticancer agent. We examined the cytotoxic, apoptotic effect of chalcones, dihydrochalcones on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT, LDH assays. The apoptosis was detected using annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy. The DeltaPsim was evaluated using DePsipher staining by fluorescence microscopy. Our study showed that two tested chalcones (chalcone, 2\\',6\\'dihydroxy-4\\'-methoxychalcone), three dihydrochalcones (2\\',6\\'-dihydroxy-4\\'4-dimethoxydihydrochalcone, 2\\',6\\'-dihydroxy-4\\'-methoxydihydro- chalcone,, 2\\',4\\',6\\'-trihydroxydihydrochalcone, called phloretin) markedly augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis, cytotoxicity in LNCaP cells, confirmed the significant role of chalcones in chemoprevention of prostate cancer.When considering methylxanthines and human health, it must be recognized that in many countries most caffeine is consumed as coffee. This is further confounded by the fact that coffee contains many bioactive substances in addition to caffeine; it is rich in phenols (quinides, chlorogenic acid, and lactones) and also has diterpenes (fatty acid esters), potassium, niacin, magnesium, and the vitamin B(3) precursor trigonelline. There is a paradox as consumption of either caffeine or caffeinated coffee results in a marked insulin resistance and yet habitual coffee consumption has repeatedly been reported to markedly reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes. There is strong evidence that caffeine reduces insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and this may be due to a combination of direct antagonism of A(1) receptors and indirectly ?-adrenergic stimulation as a result of increased sympathetic activity. Caffeine may also induce reduced hepatic glucose output. With the exception of bone mineral, there is little evidence that caffeine impacts negatively on other health issues. Coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases or cancers and there is some evidence suggesting a positive relationship for the former and for some cancers, particularly hepatic cancer.Butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, suppresses cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis through inhibition of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand signaling. Osteoclastogenesis is associated with aging, various age-related inflammatory chronic diseases, including cancer. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) ligand (RANKL), a member of the tnf superfamily, has been implicated as a major mediator of bone resorption, suggesting that agents that can suppress RANKL signaling might inhibit osteoclastogenesis, a process closely linked to bone resorption. We therefore investigated whether butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, could inhibit RANKL signaling, suppress osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL or tumor cells. We found that human multiple myeloma cells (MM.1S, U266), breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231), prostate tumor cells (PC-3) induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts, as indicated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP positive cells,, that butein suppressed this process. The chalcone also suppressed the expression of RANKL by the tumor cells. We further found that butein suppressed RANKL-induced NF-kB activation, that this suppression correlated with the inhibition of IkBalpha kinase, suppression of phosphorylation, degradation of IkBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kB. Finally, butein also suppressed the RANKL-induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts in a dose-dependent, time-dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that butein suppresses the osteoclastogenesis induced by tumor cells, by RANKL, by suppression of the NF-kB activation pathway.The polyphenol compositions of green tea (GT) and black tea (BT) are very different due to post-harvest processing. GT contains higher concentrations of monomeric polyphenols, which affect numerous intracellular signaling pathways involved in prostate cancer (CaP) development. BT polymers, on the other hand, are poorly absorbed and are converted to phenolic acids by the colonic microflora. Therefore, after consumption of GT, higher concentrations of polyphenols are found in the circulation, whereas after BT consumption the phenolic acid levels in the circulation are higher. The majority of in vitro cell culture, in vivo animal, and clinical intervention studies examine the effects of extracts of GT or purified (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on prostate carcinogenesis. These studies provide strong evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of GT, but results from epidemiological studies of GT consumption are mixed. While the evidence for a chemopreventive effect of BT is much weaker than the body of evidence with regard to GT, there are several animal BT intervention studies demonstrating inhibition of CaP growth. This article will review in detail the available epidemiological and human clinical studies, as well as animal and basic mechanistic studies on GT and BT supporting a chemopreventive role in CaP.Flavokawain B inhibits growth of human squamous carcinoma cells: Involvement of apoptosis, cell cycle dysregulation in vitro, in vivo. Flavokawain B is a natural chalcone isolated from the rhizomes of Alpenia pricei Hayata. In the present study, we have investigated the antiproliferative, apoptotic effect of flavokawain B (5-20 ??g ml 17.6-70.4 ??M) against human squamous carcinoma (KB) cells. Exposure of KB cells with flavokawain B resulted in apoptosis, evidenced by loss of cell viability, profound morphological changes, genomic DNA fragmentation, sub-G1 phase accumulation. Apoptosis induced by flavokawain B results in activation of caspase-9, -3, -8, cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), Bid in KB cells. Flavokawain B also down-regulate Bcl-2 with concomitant increase in Bax level, which resulted in release of cytochrome c. Taken together, the induction of apoptosis by flavokawain B involved in both death receptor, mitochondrial pathway. We also observed that flavokawain B caused the G2 M phase arrest that was mediated through reductions in the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, Cdc2, Cdc25C, increases in p21 WAF1, Wee1, p53 levels. Moreover, flavokawain B significantly inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-9, urokinase plasminogen activator expression, whereas tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were increased, which are playing critical role in tumor metastasis. In addition, flavokawain B treatment significantly inhibited in vivo growth of human KB cell-derived tumor xenografts in nude mice, which is evidenced by augmentation of apoptotic DNA fragmentation, as detected by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-meditated dUTP nick end-labeling staining. The induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis by flavokawain B may provide a pivotal mechanism for its cancer chemopreventive action.Gallic acid induces G??? G??? phase arrest, apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells through inhibiting cyclin D, E,, activating mitochondria-dependent pathway. Gallic acid (GA) induces apoptosis in different types of cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigate the apoptotic effects induced by GA in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells,, clarify the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that GA reduced the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose-, time-dependent manner. GA led to G(0) G(1) phase arrest in HL-60 cells through promoting p21, p27, inhibiting the levels of cyclin D, cyclin E. GA caused DNA damage, fragmentation in HL-60 cells as assayed using DAPI staining, Comet assay. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that GA increased Ca levels, reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (?√å???(m)) in HL-60 cells. Apoptotic protein expressions were determined by Western blotting. The results indicated that GA-mediated apoptosis of HL-60 cells mainly depended on mitochondrial pathway, by promoting the release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), endonuclease G (Endo G), by up-regulating the protein expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), caspase-4, caspase-9, caspase-3. In addition, GA also activated the death receptor-dependent pathway by enhancing the protein expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS), FAS ligand (FASL), caspase-8, BCL-2 interacting domain (BID). We determined the mRNA expression of the gene levels of these proteins by real-time PCR. The results showed that GA-mediated apoptosis of HL-60 cells mainly depended on up-regulation of the mRNA of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, AIF, Endo G. In conclusion, GA-induced apoptosis occurs through the death receptor, mitochondria-mediated pathways. The evaluation of GA as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of leukemia seems warranted.A synthetic chalcone as a potent inducer of glutathione biosynthesis. Chalcones continue to attract considerable interest due to their anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic properties. We recently reported the ability of 2\\',5\\'-dihydroxychalcone (2\\',5\\'-DHC) to induce both breast cancer resistance protein-mediated export of glutathione (GSH), c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated increased intracellular GSH levels. Herein, we report a structure-activity relationship study of a series of 30 synthetic chalcone derivatives with hydroxyl, methoxyl,, halogen (F, Cl) substituents, their ability to increase intracellular GSH levels. This effect was drastically improved with one or two electrowithdrawing groups on phenyl ring B, up to three methoxyl, or hydroxyl groups on phenyl ring A. The optimal structure, 2-chloro-4\\',6\\'-dimethoxy-2\\'-hydroxychalcone, induced both a potent NF-E2-related factor 2-mediated transcriptional response, an increased formation of glutamate cysteine ligase holoenzyme, as shown using a human breast cancer cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter gene driven by antioxidant response elements.Curcumin inhibits tumor proliferation induced by neutrophil elastase through the upregulation of alpha1-antitrypsin in lung cancer. Lung carcinogenesis is a complex process in an unregulated inflammatory environment. Curcumin has been extensively investigated as a multi-target anti-tumor, anti-inflammation compound. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel inflammation-related mechanism for curcumin-induced inhibition of lung tumor growth. We found that neutrophil elastase, an important regulator of inflammatory processes, directly triggered tumor cell proliferation in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells,, curcumin could completely suppress the excess tumor proliferation induced by neutrophil elastase. alpha1-antitrypsin is synthesized by tumor cells, is the natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. We found that curcumin counteracted the decrease of alpha1-antitrypsin induced by neutrophil elastase by inducing the promoter activity of alpha1-antitrypsin, promoting its expression in A549 cells. The inhibition of neutrophil elastase-induced proliferation by curcumin was dependent on the PI3K Akt pathway. Knockdown of alpha1-antitrypsin by siRNA further enhanced the tumor cell proliferation induced by neutrophil elastase, significantly blocked the anti-proliferation effect of curcumin against neutrophil elastase. Curcumin remarkably inhibited the primary tumor growth of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) in C57BL 6 mice. We further showed that curcumin upregulated the level of alpha1-antitrypsin in primary tumor tissue by promoting its local expression,, the protein level of neutrophil elastase in tumor tissue was obviously decreased in mice treated with curcumin. Overall, our results suggest that neutrophil elastase, alpha1-antitrypsin play important roles in modulating lung tumor proliferation in inflammatory microenvironment, curcumin inhibits neutrophil elastase-induced tumor proliferation via upregulating alpha1-antitrypsin expression in vitro, in vivo.Secondary Metabolites from Plants Inhibiting ABC Transporters, Reversing Resistance of Cancer Cells, Microbes to Cytotoxic, Antimicrobial Agents. Fungal, bacterial,, cancer cells can develop resistance against antifungal, antibacterial, or anticancer agents. Mechanisms of resistance are complex, often multifactorial. Mechanisms include: (1) Activation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-gp, which pump out lipophilic compounds that have entered a cell, (2) Activation of cytochrome p450 oxidases which can oxidize lipophilic agents to make them more hydrophilic, accessible for conjugation reaction with glucuronic acid, sulfate, or amino acids,, (3) Activation of glutathione transferase, which can conjugate xenobiotics. This review summarizes the evidence that secondary metabolites (SM) of plants, such as alkaloids, phenolics,, terpenoids can interfere with ABC transporters in cancer cells, parasites, bacteria,, fungi. Among the active natural products several lipophilic terpenoids monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes (including saponins), steroids (including cardiac glycosides),, tetraterpenes but also some alkaloids (isoquinoline, protoberberine, quinoline, indole, monoterpene indole,, steroidal alkaloids) function probably as competitive inhibitors of P-gp, multiple resistance-associated protein 1,, Breast cancer resistance protein in cancer cells, or efflux pumps in bacteria (NorA), fungi. More polar phenolics (phenolic acids, flavonoids, catechins, chalcones, xanthones, stilbenes, anthocyanins, tannins, anthraquinones,, naphthoquinones) directly inhibit proteins forming several hydrogen, ionic bonds, thus disturbing the 3D structure of the transporters. The natural products may be interesting in medicine or agriculture as they can enhance the activity of active chemotherapeutics or pesticides or even reverse multidrug resistance, at least partially, of adapted, resistant cells. If these SM are applied in combination with a cytotoxic or antimicrobial agent, they may reverse resistance in a synergistic fashion.Epigallocatechin-3-gallate induces mesothelioma cell death via H2 O2 -dependent T-type Ca2 channel opening. Malignant mesothelioma (MMe) is a highly aggressive, lethal tumor requiring the development of more effective therapies. The green tea polyphenol epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits the growth of many types of cancer cells. We found that EGCG is selectively cytotoxic to MMe cells with respect to normal mesothelial cells. MMe cell viability was inhibited by predominant induction of apoptosis at lower doses, necrosis at higher doses. EGCG elicited H(2) O(2) release in cell cultures,, exogenous catalase (CAT) abrogated EGCG-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, necrosis. Confocal imaging of fluo 3-loaded, EGCG-exposed MMe cells showed significant Ca rise, prevented by CAT, dithiothreitol or the T-type Ca channel blockers mibefradil, NiCl(2) . Cell loading with dihydrorhodamine 123 revealed EGCG-induced ROS production, prevented by CAT, mibefradil or the Ca chelator BAPTA-AM. Direct exposure of cells to H(2) O(2) produced similar effects on Ca , ROS,, these effects were prevented by the same inhibitors. Sensitivity of REN cells to EGCG was correlated with higher expression of Ca(v) 3.2 T-type Ca channels in these cells, compared to normal mesothelium. Also, Ca(v) 3.2 siRNA on MMe cells reduced in vitro EGCG cytotoxicity, abated apoptosis, necrosis. Intriguingly, Ca(v) 3.2 expression was observed in malignant pleural mesothelioma biopsies from patients, but not in normal pleura. In conclusion, data showed the expression of T-type Ca channels in MMe tissue, their role in EGCG selective cytotoxicity to MMe cells, suggesting the possible use of these channels as a novel MMe pharmacological target. Xanthorrhizol induces apoptosis through ROS-mediated MAPK activation in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, inhibits DMBA-induced oral carcinogenesis in hamsters. Xanthorrhizol, a natural sesquiterpenoid compound isolated from Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb, has been known to inhibit the growth of human colon, breast, liver, cervical cancer cells. In this study, xanthorrhizol decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis, decreased the level of full-length PARP in SCC-15 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. A decrease in cell viability, PARP degradation was not prevented by treatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in xanthorrhizol-treated cells. Xanthorrhizol treatment elevated intracellular Ca, ROS levels in SCC-15 cells. Treatment with a Ca chelator, EGTA AM, did not affect xanthorrhizol- induced cytotoxicity, but cell viability was partly recovered by treatment with endogenous antioxidant, GSH, or hydroxy radical trapper, MCI-186. Furthermore, the viability of xanthorrhizol-treated SCC-15 cells was significantly restored by treatment with SB203580, or SP600125 but not significantly by PD98059 treatment. Xanthorrhizol-induced activation of p38 MAPK, JNK was blocked by MCI-186. Finally, xanthorrhizol suppressed the number of tumors in buccal pouches, increased the survival rate in hamsters treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz a anthracene. In conclusion, xanthorrhizol may induce caspase-independent apoptosis through ROS-mediated p38 MAPK, JNK activation in SCC-15 OSCC cells, prevent chemical-induced oral carcinogenesis. Therefore, xanthorrhizol seems to be a promising chemopreventive agent.Curcumin suppresses the TPA-induced invasion through inhibition of PKCalpha-dependent MMP-expression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a polyphenol derived from the plant turmeric (Curcuma longa), which is commonly used as a spice. Although anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation,, anti-angiogenic properties have been reported, the effect of curcumin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a major component in cancer cell invasion. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of curcumin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA induced MMP-9 expression, cell invasion, the molecular mechanisms involved in MCF-7 cells. Our results showed that curcumin inhibits TPA-induced MMP-9 expression, cell invasion through suppressing NF-kB, AP-1 activation. Also, curcumin strongly repressed the TPA-induced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, inhibited TPA-induced translocation of PKCalpha from the cytosol to the membrane, but did not affect the translocation of PKCdelta. These results indicate that curcumin-mediated inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression, cell invasion involves the suppression of the PKCalpha, MAPK, NF-kB AP-1 pathway in MCF-7 cells. Curcumin may have potential value in restricting breast cancer metastasis.Novel involvement of leukotriene B??? receptor 2 through ERK activation by PP2A down-regulation in leukotriene B???-induced keratin phosphorylation, reorganization of pancreatic cancer cells. Perinuclear reorganization via phosphorylation of specific serine residues in keratin is involved in the deformability of metastatic cancer cells. The level of leukotriene B??? is high in pancreatic cancers. However, the roles of LTB???, its cognate receptors in keratin reorganization of pancreatic cancers are not known. LTB??? dose-dependently induced phosphorylation, reorganization of Keratin 8 (K8), these processes were reversed by LY255283 (BLT2 antagonist). BLT2 agonists such as Comp A, 15(S HETE also induced phosphorylation of serine 431 in K8. Moreover, Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation, reorganization were blocked by LY255283. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation, reorganization in PANC-1 cells. Over-expression of BLT2 promoted K8 phosphorylation. Comp A promoted the migration of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner,, LY255283 blocked Comp A-induced migration, respectively. PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) suppressed Comp A-induced phosphorylation of serine 431, reorganization of K8. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed the expression of pERK,, over-expression of BLT2 increased the expression of pERK even without Comp A. Comp A induced the expression of active ERK (pERK), BLT2. These inductions were blocked by PD98059. Comp A decreased PP2A expression, hindered the binding of PP2A to the K8, leading to the activation of ERK. PD98059 suppressed the Comp A-induced migration of PANC-1 cells, BLT2 over-expression-induced migration of PANC-1 cells. Overall, these results suggest that BLT2 is involved in LTB(4 induced phosphorylation, reorganization through ERK activation by PP2A downregulation, leading to increased migration of PANC-1 cells.Effect of l-phenylalanine on PAL activity, production of naphthoquinone pigments in suspension cultures of Arnebia euchroma (Royle) Johnst. The effects of l-phenylalanine (PHE) on cell growth, production of shikonin, its derivatives, acetylshikonin (ACS), isobutyrylshikonin (IBS), in suspension cultures of Arnebia euchroma were examined. Supplementing media using PHE have been successfully utilized to enhance shikonin production in cell cultures of other species of Boraginaceae. l-Phenylalanine, the key compound in the phenylpropanoid pathway, is converted by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to trans-cinnamic acid, which is the precursor of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHB). Coupling of PHB, geranyl pyrophosphate (derived from mevalonate pathway) by p-hydroxybenzoate-m-geranyltransferase leads later to biosynthesis of shikonins. The addition of 0.01 or 0.1? mM PHE to the culture medium stimulated cell proliferation, where the highest observed increase in fresh cell biomass (measured as a ratio of final weight to initial weight) was 12-fold, in contrast to an eightfold increase in control cultures. Whereas, growth media supplemented with 1? mM PHE markedly reduced the rate of cell growth (to only twofold). Precursor feeding had detrimental effects on both ACS, IBS production in all PHE-supplemented media. The highest total content (intracellular extracellular) of the investigated red pigments (9.5? mg per flask) was detected in the control culture without PHE. ACS was the major component of the naphthoquinone fraction determined in cells, post-culture media. Shikonin itself was found only in the post-culture media from cultures supplemented with 0.01 or 0.1? mM PHE. Increases in PAL activity corresponded well with the accumulation of investigated naphthoquinones in control culture. However, peak PAL activity did not directly correlate with maximum production of shikonin derivatives. Cytotoxicity of extracts, prepared from the cells cultivated in the presence of PHE or in control cultures, was tested on three cancer cell lines: HL-60, HeLa,, MCF-7. The extracts prepared from the untreated control cultures proved to be the most potent against the examined cancer cell lines. The mean inhibitory concentration values were 0.3, 13,, 8? ??g? ml for the HL-60, HeLa,, MCF-7 cells, respectively.Glycolysis inhibitor screening identifies the bis-geranylacylphloroglucinol protonophore moronone from Moronobea coccinea. Tumor cells exhibit enhanced glucose consumption, lactate production even when supplied with adequate oxygen (a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, or aerobic glycolysis). Pharmacological inhibition of aerobic glycolysis represents a potential tumor-selective approach that targets the metabolic differences between normal, malignant tissues. Human breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells were used to develop an assay system to discover natural product-based glycolysis inhibitors. The assay employed was based on hypersensitivity to glycolytic inhibition in tumor cells treated with the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor rotenone. Under such conditions, ATP supply,, hence cell viability, depends exclusively on glycolysis. This assay system was used to evaluate 10648 plant, marine organism extracts from the U.S. National Cancer Institute\\'s Open Repository. Bioassay-guided isolation of an active Moronobea coccinea extract yielded the new bis-geranylacylphloroglucinol derivative moronone (1). Compound 1 exhibited enhanced antiproliferative cytotoxic activity in the presence of rotenone-imposed metabolic stress on tumor cells. Surprisingly, mechanistic studies revealed that 1 did not inhibit glycolysis, but rather functions as a protonophore that dissipates the mitochondrial proton gradient. In the presence of rotenone, tumor cells may be hypersensitive to protonophores due to increased ATP utilization by the ATP synthase.Multifunctional albumin nanoparticles as combination drug carriers for intra-tumoral chemotherapy. Current cancer therapies are challenged by weakly soluble drugs, by drug combinations that exhibit non-uniform biodistribution, poor bioavailability. In this study, we have presented a new platform of advanced healthcare materials based on albumin nanoparticles (ANPs) engineered as tumor penetrating, delivery vehicles of combinatorially applied factors to solid tumors. These materials were designed to overcome three sequential key barriers: tissue level transport across solid tumor matrix uptake kinetics into individual cancer cells therapeutic resistance to single chemotherapeutic drugs. The ANPs were designed to penetrate deeper into solid tumor matrices using collagenase decoration, evaluated using a three-dimensional multicellular melanoma tumor spheroid model. Collagenase modified ANPs exhibited 1-2 orders of magnitude greater tumor penetration than unmodified ANPs into the spheroid mass after 96 hours,, showed preferential uptake into individual cancer cells for smaller sized ANPs (<100 nm). For enhanced efficacy, collagenase coated ANPs were modified with two therapeutic agents, curcumin, riluzole, with complementary mechanisms of action for combined cell cycle arrest, apoptosis in melanoma. The collagenase coated, drug loaded nanoparticles induced significantly more cell death within 3-D tumor models than the unmodified, dual drug loaded ANP particles, the kinetics of cytotoxicity was further influenced by the ANP size. Thus, multifunctional nanoparticles can be imbued with complementary size, protease activity features that allow them to penetrate solid tumors, deliver combinatorial therapeutic payload with enhanced cancer cytotoxicity but minimal collateral damage to healthy primary cells. Anticancer activity of flavonol, flavan-3-ol rich extracts from Croton celtidifolius latex. Croton celtidifolius Baill (Euphorbiaceae) is a tree found in the Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil, where it is commonly known as Sangue-de-Drag??o. Its red latex is used traditionally for treating ulcers, diabetes, cancer. To evaluate antitumor activities of Croton celtififolius latex in vitro, in vivo. Phytochemical analyses were conducted using HPLC-DAD-MS. Cytotoxic, nuclease, pro-apoptotic properties were determined using the tetrazolium salt assay (MTT), plasmid DNA damage assay, ethidium bromide (EB) acridine orange methods, respectively,, antitumor activity was determined in the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) mouse model. Phytochemical studies indicated a high phenol content of flavonols (45.67????????0.24, 18.01????????0.23???mg mL of myricetin, quercetin, respectively), flavan-3-ols (114.12????????1.84, 1527.41????????16.42???mg L of epicatechin, epigallocatechin, respectively) in latex. These compounds reduced MCF-7, EAC cell viability in the MTT assay (IC50???=???169.0????????1.8, 187.0????????2.2?????g mL, respectively). Latex compounds caused significant DNA fragmentation, increased the number of apoptotic cells (negative control (NC), 12% latex, 41%) as indicated by differential staining in the EB acridine orange assay. The in vivo latex treatment at 3.12???mg kg day reduced the body weight by 7.57????????2.04???g, increased median survival time to 17.5 days when compared to the NC group (13.0 days). In addition, the highest latex concentration inhibited tumor growth by 56%. These results agree with ethno-pharmacological reports showing cytotoxicity, antitumor activity of C. celtidifolius latex. The mechanism of antitumor action may be related to direct DNA fragmentation that reduces survival, induces apoptosis.6-Shogaol inhibits breast, colon cancer cell proliferation through activation of peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). 6-Shogaol has been shown to possess many antitumor properties including inhibition of cancer cell growth, inhibition of cancer metastasis, induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, induction of cancer cell differentiation. Despite its prominent antitumor effects, the direct molecular target of 6-shogaol has remained elusive. To identify the direct targets of 6-shogaol, a comprehensive antitumor profile of 6-shogaol (NSC752389) was tested in the NCI-60 cell line in an in vitro screen. The results show that 6-shogaol is COMPARE negative suggesting that it functions via a mechanism of action distinct from existing classes of therapeutic agents. Further analysis using microarray gene profiling, Connectivity Map analysis showed that MCF-7 cells treated with 6-shogaol display gene expression signatures characteristic of pparg (PPARgamma) agonists, suggesting that 6-shogaol may activate the PPARgamma signaling pathway for its antitumor effects. Indeed, treatment of MCF-7, HT29 cells with 6-shogaol induced PPARgamma transcriptional activity, suppressed NFkB activity,, induced apoptosis in breast, colon cancer cells in a PPARgamma-dependent manner. Furthermore, 6-shogaol is capable of binding to PPARgamma with a binding affinity comparable to 15-delta prostaglandin J2, a natural ligand for PPARgamma. Together, our findings suggest that the antitumor effects of 6-shogaol are mediated through activation of PPARgamma, imply that activation of PPARgamma might be beneficial for breast, colon cancer treatment.The role of phenolic compounds in the fight against cancer--a review. Cancer is a worldwide scourge it\\'s the leading cause of death in developed countries, is increasing in developing countries. Mankind has been trying with effort to find better, cheaper treatments with fewer side effects, to reduce the incidence of the disease, its consequent mortality. For many years, phenolic compounds have been intensely studied for their antitumor, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic effects. In recent years, the usage of these compounds has increased considerably. This manuscript intends to structurally characterize the different phenolic compounds (flavonoids, hydroxycinnamates, hydroxybenzoates, coumarins, xanthones, chalcones, stilbenes, lignins, lignans), their metabolic pathways as well as review the most important results regarding these compounds, their derivatives in cancer treatment, prevention both in tumor cell lines in vitro, in murine models in vivo, finally some results regarding human trials. Identification of novel bioactive metabolites of 5-demethylnobiletin in mice. Biotransformation of dietary components is important for their in vivo biological activities after oral ingestion. Herein, we investigated biotransformation of 5-demethylnobiletin (a polymethoxyflavone found in citrus fruits) in mice,, its implication in the inhibition of human colon cancer cells. Urine samples were collected from mice fed with 5-demethylnobiletin (1), analyzed by LC-ESI-MS, HPLC coupled with an electrochemical detector. Three major metabolites were identified as 5,3\\'-didemethylnobiletin (2), 5,4\\'-didemethylnobiletin (3),, 5,3\\',4\\'-tridemethylnobiletin (4) by comparing their ESI-MS, HPLC profiles with those of authentic standards synthesized by a multistep route. Cell viability assay in human colon cancer cells demonstrated that all three metabolites of 5-demethylnobiletin, especially 5,3\\'-didemethylnobiletin (2), showed much stronger inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth than 5-demethylnobiletin. For example, metabolites (2-4) showed IC50 of 0.12, 5.5,, 4.2 ??M in SW620 cells, respectively, while 5-demethylnobiletin at 10 ??M only caused 37% inhibition after 72 h of treatment. Three novel metabolites were identified in mice after oral administration of 5-demethylniobiletin. These metabolites exhibited strong inhibitory effects against human colon cancer cells. Our results provide a first report on these bioactive metabolites, warrant further investigation on their molecular mechanism of actions.Antioxidant, pro-apoptotic effects of marine-derived, multi-mineral aquamin supplemented with a pine bark extract, Enzogenol,, a green tea extract, Sunphenon. A high dietary intake of polyphenols has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, attributed in part to their antioxidant activity, pro-apoptotic effects. Aquamin is a multi-mineral algal extract that enhances bone mineralization, relieves osteoarthritis,, aids digestion however, Aquamin has not demonstrated antioxidant activity. In the present study, Aquamin was supplemented with 8% Enzogenol, a pine bark extract with a high phenolic content,, 2% Sunphenon, a green tea extract that also has a high phenolic content to produce a mixed product (A:E:S). The antioxidant activity of A:E:S was compared with that of its constituent compounds, also with catechin, epigallocatechin by measuring total phenol content, ferric-reducing antioxidant potential,, 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate. The cytotoxic, apoptotic effects of the compounds were also measured in the U937, human monocytic blood cell line. A:E:S demonstrated an antioxidant activity that was equal to that of the compounds used in its preparation. A:E:S was cytotoxic, the primary mechanism of cell death was apoptosis. The biological effects of Aquamin were enhanced by supplementation with Enzogenol, Sunphenon to include antioxidant effects, the ability to induce apoptosis in U937 cells.6 -Gingerol Prevents Disassembly of Cell Junctions, Activities of MMPs in Invasive Human Pancreas Cancer Cells through ERK NF- k B Snail Signal Transduction Pathway. To study the effects of 6 -gingerol, a ginger phytochemical, on tight junction (TJ) molecules, we investigated TJ tightening, signal transduction pathways in human pancreatic duct cell-derived cancer cell line PANC-1. The following methods were utilized: MTT assay to determine cytotoxicity zymography to examine matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), paracellular flux for TJ measurement RT-PCR, immunoblotting for proteins related to TJ, invasion, EMSA for NF- k B activity in PANC-1 cells.   revealed that TER significantly increased, claudin 4, MMP-9 decreased compared to those of the control. TJ protein levels, including zonula occludens (ZO-) 1, occludin,, E-cadherin, increased in 6 -gingerol-treated cells, which correlated with a decrease in paracellular flux, MMP activity. Furthermore, NF- k B Snail nuclear translocation was suppressed via downregulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in response to 6 -gingerol treatment. Moreover, treatment with U0126, an ERK inhibitor, completely blocked NF- k B activity. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that 6 -gingerol regulates TJ-related proteins, suppresses invasion, metastasis through NF- k B Snail inhibition via inhibition of the ERK pathway. Therefore, 6 -gingerol may suppress the invasive activity of PANC-1 cells. Role of adipokines, cytokines in obesity-associated breast cancer: therapeutic targets. Obesity is the cause of a large proportion of breast cancer incidences, mortality in post-menopausal women. In obese people, elevated levels of various growth factors such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are found. Elevated insulin level leads to increased secretion of estrogen by binding to the circulating sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The increased estrogen-mediated downstream signaling favors breast carcinogenesis. Obesity leads to altered expression profiles of various adipokines, cytokines including leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-beta. The increased levels of leptin, decreased adiponectin secretion are directly associated with breast cancer development. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the tumor microenvironment promote tumor development. Efficacy of available breast cancer drugs against obesity-associated breast cancer is yet to be confirmed. In this review, we will discuss different adipokine-, cytokine-mediated molecular signaling pathways involved in obesity-associated breast cancer, available therapeutic strategies, potential therapeutic targets for obesity-associated breast cancer.Scientific validation of the medicinal efficacy of Tinospora cordifolia. Present communication reports the scientific evaluation of Tinospora cordifolia for its medicinal efficacy which includes phytochemical screening, antimicrobial, antioxidant,, anticancer activities of the plant. Secondary metabolites including anthraquinones, terpenoids,, saponins were present in many extracts in addition to phenolics. Total phenol contents in various extracts were found in the range of 8.75-52.50 catechol equivalent per gram (CE g). In disc diffusion assays, polar extracts exhibited considerable inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Several other extracts also showed antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains of E. coli, Pseudomonas spp.,, Proteus spp. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of potential extracts were found between 1.29, 22.73 mg mL. The lowest MBC (1.29 mg mL) was recorded for acetone, ethyl acetate extracts against K. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp., respectively. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was comparable to that of standard antioxidants, concentration-dependent response was shown in reducing power assay. Aqueous extracts demonstrated substantial metal ion chelating activity (67-95%) at lower concentrations (10-40 ?? g mL). Other extracts also exhibited considerable metal chelating response. Most of the extracts revealed considerable inhibition of MCF-7 cancer cell line. The study established remarkable antibacterial, antioxidant,, anticancer potential in T. cordifolia stem extracts.Inhibition of IkB kinase-beta, IkB kinase-alpha by heterocyclic adamantyl arotinoids. We recently reported on a series of retinoid-related molecules containing an adamantyl group, a.k.a. adamantyl arotinoids (AdArs), that showed significant cancer cell growth inhibitory activity, activated RXRalpha (NR2B1) in transient transfection assays while devoid of RAR transactivation capacity. We have now explored whether these AdArs could also bind, inhibit IKKbeta, a known target that mediates the induction of apoptosis, cancer cell growth inhibition by related AdArs containing a chalcone functional group. In addition, we have prepared, evaluated novel AdArs that incorporate a central heterocyclic ring connecting the adamantyl-phenol, the carboxylic acid at the polar termini. Our results indicate that the majority of the RXRalpha activating compounds lacked IKKbeta inhibitory activity. In contrast, the novel heterocyclic AdArs containing a thiazole or pyrazine ring linked to a benzoic acid motif were potent inhibitors of both IKKalpha, IKKbeta, which in most cases paralleled significant growth inhibitory, apoptosis inducing activities.Licochalcone A suppresses migration, invasion of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells through downregulation of MKK4 JNK via NF-kB mediated urokinase plasminogen activator expression. Hepatocellular cell carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide, in Taiwan. Chemoprevention of cancer with dietary bioactive compounds could potentially reverse, suppress, or prevent cancer progression. Licochalcone A (LicA) is a characteristic chalcone of licorice, which is the root of Glycyrrhiza inflate. It had been reported that LicA has anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial,, anti-tumor properties. However, the effects of LicA on the migration, invasion of human HCC cells have not yet been reported. In the present study, it was found that LicA inhibits the migratory, invasion ability of SK-Hep-1, HA22T VGH cells in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed by the cell migration, Matrigel cell invasion assay. Using casein zymography, Western blotting, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,, an immunofluorescence assay, it was found that LicA induces a dose-dependent inhibition of uPA activity, expression, as well as reduces mRNA levels in SK-Hep-1, HA22T VGH cells. LicA was also found to inhibit the expression of phosphor-JNK, phosphor-MKK4 in SK-Hep-1 cells. Furthermore, LicA significantly decreased uPA levels in SP600125-treated or si-MKK4-transfected cells alongside a marked reduction in cell migration, invasion, which supports the notion that an inhibition of MKK4 JNK results in anti-metastatic effects. Moreover, LicA inhibited the expression of nuclear NF-kB, as well as the binding ability of NF-kB to the uPA promoter. These findings further our understanding of the role of LicA in suppressing tumor metastasis, its underlying molecular mechanisms, as well as suggest that LicA may be a promising anti-metastatic agent. Curcumin Regulates Colon Cancer by Inhibiting P-Glycoprotein in In-situ Cancerous Colon Perfusion Rat Model. Studies on p-glycoprotein was carried out world vide with cell lines like Caco2, MDR1-LLC-PK1, MDR1-MDCK in-vitro, but most of the results were failed to produce similar results in-vivo. In the present study curcumin inhibitory action on p-glycoprotein increased permeability of irinotecan, so in the colon cancer it would be beneficial if curcumin used as add on therapy. Intra-rectal administered of N-Nitroso N-methyl urea (2 mg Kg) induced colon cancer. Single pass whole length of colon in-situ perfusion was carried out in rats with irinotecan to study the influence of p-glycoprotein modulators like verapamil, curcumin. The rats were divided in to 5 groups (n=6), Group I served as control perfused with 30 ??g ml of irinotecan, propronolol, phenol red. Group II was cancerous group, induced by N-methyl N-nitroso urea. Group III was perfused with irinotican in cancerous rats. Group IV, perfused with irinotican in presence of verapamil, group V was pre-treated with curcumin, then perfused with irinotican, was estimated by HPLC-UV to effective permeability coefficient. Our qRT-PCR, Western blot results confirmed that about 15-fold decreases in the expression of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) in curcumin treated colon cancer cells. Irinotecan was increased to 0.00066 cm s, about 11-fold increase in verapamil-coperfused group, where curcumin pre-treated group irinotecan was increases 0.00006 cm s to 0.00042 cm s that is about 7-fold increase p-glycoprotein inhibitory activity by verapamil, curcumin found to be significantly enhanced the cancerous colon permeability of irinotecan. Any safe suitable p-glycoprotein inhibitors along with irinotecan will enhance the therapeutic benefit in the treatment of the colon cancer.Design, synthesis, biological evaluation of new inhibitors of Bax Bcl-xL interaction in cancer cells. We describe the synthesis of a series of new molecules containing phenol, triazoles moieties, compounds which have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit Bax Bcl-xL interactions in cancer cells, by using BRET assays,, to induce cell death. Several derivatives exhibit a very promising activity, being more potent than the reference compounds acylpyrogallol A, ABT-737. These preliminary results demonstrate that derivatives of this family can be attractive to develop new molecules with potent anticancer activity.Iso-suillin isolated from Suillus luteus, induces G1 phase arrest, apoptosis in human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. Iso-suillin, a natural product isolated from Suillus luteus, has been shown to inhibit the growth of some cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms of action of this compound are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate how iso-suillin inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis in a human hepatoma cell line (SMMC-7721). We demonstrated the effects of iso-suillin on cell proliferation, apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells, with no apparent toxicity in normal human lymphocytes, using colony formation assays, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of G1 phase-regulated, apoptosis-associated protein levels in iso-suillin treated SMMC-7721 cells. The results indicated that iso-suillin significantly decreased viability, induced G1 phase arrest, triggered apoptosis in SMMC-7721cells. Taken together, these results suggest the potential of iso-suillin as a candidate for liver cancer treatment. Hypoxia differentially regulated CXCR4, CXCR7 signaling in colon cancer. HIF-1alpha, CXCR4 CXCL12 have crucial roles in the metastatic process of colorectal cancer. Our aim was to study the significance of targeting HIF-1alpha, the CXCR4 CXCL12 axis in colorectal cancer to prevent the dissemination process in vitro. We investigated CXCR4, CXCR7 mRNA, protein expression in human colon carcinomas, the modulation of their expression by hypoxia, HIF-1alpha in colon cancer cell lines. The migration of tumor cells in a Boyden chamber was studied after CXCR4 inhibition with siRNA or the CXCR4 CXCL12 neutraligand, chalcone 4. Analysis of a cohort of colon polyps, chromosome-unstable carcinomas showed that the expression of CXCR4, CXCR7 was similar to that of the normal mucosa in the polyps, early-stage carcinomas but significantly increased in late stage carcinomas. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia strongly induced the expression of CXCR4 transcript, protein at the cell membrane, both regulated by HIF-1alpha, whereas CXCR7 expression was independent of hypoxia. After transient hypoxia, CXCR4 levels remained stable at the cell membrane up to 48? hours. Furthermore, reducing CXCR4 expression impaired CXCL12-induced Akt phosphorylation, whereas Erk activation remained unchanged. In contrast, reducing CXCR7 expression did not affect Akt nor Erk activation. In the presence of CXCR4 or CXCR7 siRNAs, a significant reduction in cell migration occurred (37%, 17%, respectively). Although irinotecan inhibited cell migration by 20% (p <0.001), the irinotecan, chalcone 4 combination further increased inhibition to 40% (p <0.001). We demonstrated, for the first time, that hypoxia upregulated CXCR4 but not CXCR7 expression in tumor cells, that the CXCR4 receptor protein level remains high at the cell membrane when the tumor cells return to normoxia for up to 48? hours. In addition we showed the interest to inhibit the CXCR4 signaling by inhibiting both the HIF-1alpha, CXCR4 CXCL12 pathway. CXCR4 seems to be a relevant target because it is continuously expressed, functional both in normoxic, hypoxic conditions in tumor cells.Polyphenols are responsible for the proapoptotic properties of pomegranate juice on leukemia cell lines. Pomegranates have shown great promise as anti-cancer agents in a number of cancers including clinical trials in prostate cancer. We have previously shown pomegranate juice (PGJ) induced apoptosis, preferentially alters the cell cycle in leukemia cell lines compared with nontumor control cells. However, the agents responsible have not yet been fully elucidated. Treatment of four leukemia cell lines with five fractions obtained from PGJ by solid phase extraction demonstrated that only the acetonitrile fractions decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in all leukemia cell lines. Acetonitrile fractions also significantly activated caspase-3, induced nuclear morphology characteristic of apoptosis. S phase arrest was induced by acetonitrile fractions which matched S phase arrest seen previously following whole PGJ treatments. The acetonitrile fractions contained higher phenol content than whole PGJ whereas only low levels of phenols were seen in any other fraction. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis demonstrated that acetonitrile fractions were enriched in ellagitannins, ellagic acid,, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives but depleted in anthocyanins. Individual treatments with identified compounds demonstrated that the ellagitannin: punicalagin was the most active, mimicked the responses seen following acetonitrile fraction treatment. Bioactive components within pomegranate were confined to the acetonitrile fraction of PGJ. The enrichment in ellagitannins, hydroxycinnamic acids suggest these may provide the majority of the bioactivities of PGJ. Individual treatments with compounds identified demonstrated that the ellagitannin: punicalagin was the most active agent, highlighting this compound as a key bioactive agent in PGJTargeting esr1 subtypes (ERalpha, ERbeta) with selective ER modulators in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer cells express both esr1 (ERalpha), ERbeta,, hormonal therapy is an attractive treatment option because of its relatively few side effects. However, estrogen was previously shown to have opposite effects in tumors expressing ERalpha compared with ERbeta, indicating that the two receptor subtypes may have opposing effects. This may explain the modest response to nonselective estrogen inhibition in clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of selectively targeting each ER subtype on ovarian cancer growth. Ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3, OV2008, expressing both ER subtypes, were treated with highly selective ER modulators. Sodium 3\\'-(1-(phenylaminocarbonyl 3,4-tetrazolium bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) assay revealed that treatment with 1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl 4-methyl-5- 4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol -1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride (MPP) (ERalpha antagonist) or 2,3-bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl propionitrile (DPN) (ERbeta agonist) significantly suppressed cell growth in both cell lines. In contrast, 4,4\\',4???-(4-propyl- 1H -pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) (ERalpha agonist) or 4- 2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo 1,5-a -pyrimidin-3-yl phenol (PHTPP) (ERbeta antagonist) significantly enhanced cell growth. These results were confirmed on a xenograft model where SKOV3 cells were injected s.c. into ovariectomized mice. We observed that the average size of xenografts in both the DPN-treated group, the MPP-treated group was significantly smaller than that for the vehicle-treated group. In addition, we found that phospho-AKT expressions in SKOV3 cells were reduced by 80% after treatment with MPP, DPN, indicating that the AKT pathway was involved. The combined treatment with MPP, DPN had a synergistic effect in suppressing ovarian cancer cell growth. Our findings indicate that targeting ER subtypes may enhance the response to hormonal treatment in women with ovarian cancer. Quinoxaline-substituted chalcones as new inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2: polyspecificity at B-ring position. A series of chalcones substituted by a quinoxaline unit at the B-ring were synthesized, tested as inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein-mediated mitoxantrone efflux. These compounds appeared more efficient than analogs containing other B-ring substituents such as 2-naphthyl or 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl while an intermediate inhibitory activity was obtained with a 1-naphthyl group. In all cases, two or three methoxy groups had to be present on the phenyl A-ring to produce a maximal inhibition. Molecular modeling indicated both electrostatic, steric positive contributions. A higher potency was observed when the 2-naphthyl or 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl group was shifted to the A-ring, methoxy substituents were shifted to the phenyl B-ring, indicating preferences among polyspecificity of inhibition. Trilobatin attenuates the LPS-mediated inflammatory response by suppressing the NF-kB signaling pathway. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of trilobatin, the flavonoid isolated from the leaves of Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. Treatment with trilobatin (0.005-5 ??M) dose-dependently inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS induced mRNA expression, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tnf (TNFalpha), interleukin-beta (IL-beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), in RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, no further inhibition was detected when the concentration of trilobatin was increased to 50 ??M. Western blot analysis confirmed that the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect was correlated with the inhibition of LPS-induced inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IkBalpha) degradation, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) p65 phosphorylation. In addition, trilobatin also showed a significant inhibition of LPS-induced TNFalpha, IL-6 at both the mRNA, protein levels in a mouse model. Our results suggest that trilobatin potentially inhibits the LPS-induced inflammatory response by suppressing the NF-kB signaling pathway. Pterostilbene suppresses oral cancer cell invasion by inhibiting MMP-2 expression. Polyphenol compounds, present in a wide variety of natural plants, exhibit antioxidant, free radical scavenging ability, induce apoptosis in various cancer cells. However, the effect of pterostilbene on oral cancer cell metastasis has not been clarified. The present study aimed to examine the anti-metastatic properties of pterostilbene in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC 9 cells. In this study, pterostilbene treatment significantly inhibited migration invasion capacities of SCC-9 cells in vitro. The results of zymography, western blotting revealed that the activities, protein levels of the MMP-2, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) was inhibited by pterostilbene. Western blot analysis also showed that pterostilbene inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt, erk1 , erk2, p38. Determinations of the mRNA levels, real-time polymerase chain reaction, promoter assays were conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effects of pterostilbene on MMP-2, u-PA expression in SCC-9 cells. Such inhibitory effects were associated with the upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, the downregulation of the transcription factors of NF-kB, SP-1, CREB signaling pathways. Pterostilbene may have potential use as a chemopreventive agent against oral cancer metastasis.A natural androgen receptor antagonist induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells. We have previously identified a natural occurring, androgen receptor-specific antagonist. Atraric acid (AA) inhibits the transactivation of the androgen receptor (AR), androgen-mediated growth of AR-expressing human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines. Here we show that AA treatment of living cells provokes molecular changes of AR signaling. In addition to a deceleration of nuclear translocation a block of the intramolecular amino carboxy (N C terminal interaction of the AR was observed. Furthermore, using high-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy, a reduced speckle formation of the AR was observed in line with an increased intranuclear mobility of the receptor. This suggests decreased DNA binding of the AR, which is further indicated by an impaired chromatin recruitment of the AR to the prostate-specific antigen promoter, enhancer shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Using inhibitors of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src or Akt, known interaction partners of AR, reduced the level of androgen-induced cellular senescence suggesting a partly non-genomic pathway to induce cellular senescence by AA. Using PP2 (4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl 7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo 3,4-d pyrimidine) pyrimidine or Akt inhibitors, inhibitors of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src or Akt, known interaction partners of AR, reduced the level of androgen-induced cellular senescence, suggesting a partly nongenomic pathway to induce cellular senescence by AA. Treatment of LNCaP cells with AA is associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, an increase of p16 expression, whereas the p53-p21 signaling pathway seems not be affected by AA treatment. Analyzing human PCa tissue samples treated with AA ex vivo also indicates an induction of cellular senescence associated with an increase of p16 expression but not p21. Taken together, these data indicate that AA exhibits novel features to inhibit AR amino carboxy-terminal interaction, the AR-mediated nuclear activities, growth of PCa cells.Fatty acid esters of phloridzin induce apoptosis of human liver cancer cells through altered gene expression. Phloridzin (phlorizin or phloretin 2\\'-O-glucoside) is known for blocking intestinal glucose absorption. We have investigated the anticarcinogenic effect of phloridzin, its novel derivatives using human cancer cell lines. We have synthesised novel acylated derivatives of phloridzin with six different long chain fatty acids by regioselective enzymatic acylation using Candida Antarctica lipase B. The antiproliferative effects of the new compounds were investigated in comparison with the parent compounds, phloridzin, aglycone phloretin, the six free fatty acids, chemotherapeutic drugs (sorafenib, doxorubicin, daunorubicin) using human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells along with normal human, rat hepatocytes. The fatty acid esters of phloridzin inhibited significantly the growth of the two carcinoma, leukemia cells while similar treatment doses were not toxic to normal human or rat hepatocytes. The antiproliferative potency of fatty esters of phloridzin was comparable to the potency of the chemotherapeutic drugs. The fatty acid esters of phloridzin inhibited DNA topoisomerases IIalpha activity that might induce G0 G1 phase arrest, induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3,, decreased ATP level, mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 cells. Based on the high selectivity on cancer cells, decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ester of phloridzin was selected for gene expression analysis using RT2PCR human cancer drug target array. Antiproliferative effect of DHA ester of phloridzin could be related to the down regulation of anti-apoptotic gene (BCL2), growth factor receptors (EBFR family, IGF1R IGF2, PDGFR), its downstream signalling partners (PI3k AKT mTOR, Ras Raf MAPK), cell cycle machinery (CDKs, TERT, TOP2A, TOP2B) as well as epigenetics regulators (HDACs). These results suggest that fatty esters of phloridzin have potential chemotherapeutic effects mediated through the attenuated expression of several key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA topoisomerases IIalpha activity, epigenetic mechanisms followed by cell cycle arrest, apoptosis. Studies of synthetic chalcone derivatives as potential inhibitors of secretory phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenase, pro-inflammatory cytokines. Arachidonic acid metabolism leads to the generation of key lipid mediators which play a fundamental role during inflammation. The inhibition of enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism has been considered as a synergistic anti-inflammatory effect with enhanced spectrum of activity. A series of 1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-one derivatives were investigated for anti-inflammatory related activities involving inhibition of secretory phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenases, soybean lipoxygenase,, lipopolysaccharides-induced secretion of interleukin-6, tnf in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. The results from the above mentioned assays exhibited that the synthesized compounds were effective inhibitors of pro-inflammatory enzymes, cytokines. The results also revealed that the chalcone derivatives with 4-methlyamino ethanol substitution seem to be significant for inhibition of enzymes, cytokines. Molecular docking experiments were carried out to elucidate the molecular aspects of the observed inhibitory activities of the investigated compounds. Present findings increase the possibility that these chalcone derivatives might serve as a beneficial starting point for the design, development of improved anti-inflammatory agents. Verbascoside promotes apoptosis by regulating HIPK2-p53 signaling in human colorectal cancer. We investigated the role of the HIPK2-p53 signaling pathway in tumorigenesis, resistance to the drug Verbascoside (VB) in colorectal cancer (CRC), using in vivo, in vitro experiments. Primary human CRC samples, normal intestinal tissues from patients were analyzed for HIPK2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), its expression was correlated against patients\\' clinicopathological characteristics. Human CRC HCT-116 cells were implanted in BALB c nude mice mice with xenografted tumors were randomly administrated vehicle (control), 20, 40, or 80 mg mL VB, or 1 mg mL fluorouracil (5-FU). HIPK2, p53, Bax,, Bcl-2 expression in these tumors were determined by IHC. In vitro effects of VB on CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry HIPK2, p53, p-p53, Bax,, Bcl-2 were measured by western blot. IHC analysis for 100 human CRC tumor samples, 20 normal intestinal tissues, showed HIPK2 expression to inversely correlate with Dukes stage, depth of invasion in CRC (P<0.05). In vivo, the inhibition rates of 20, 40,, 80 mg mL VB on CRC xenograft tumor weight were 42.79%, 53.90%,, 60.99%, respectively,, were accompanied by increased expression of HIPK2, p53,, Bax,, decreased Bcl-2 expression in treated tumors. In vitro, VB significantly inhibited proliferation of CRC cell lines HCT-116, HT-29, LoVo,, SW620, in a time-, dose-dependent manner. The apoptosis rates of 25, 50,, 100 ??M VB on HCT-116 cells were 10.83??1.28, 11.25??1.54,, 20.19??2.87%,, on HT-29 cells were 18.92??6.12, 21.57??4.05,, 25.14??6.73%, respectively. In summary, VB treatment significantly enhanced the protein expression of pro-apoptotic HIPK2, p53, p-p53, Bax,, decreased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression in CRC cells. HIPK2 protein modulates the phosphorylation status of p53,, levels of Bax, Bcl-2 in CRC. We also found that VB effectively activated the HIPK2-p53 signaling pathway, resulting in increased CRC cell apoptosis.Natural daucane esters induces apoptosis in leukaemic cells through ROS production. Continuing our research on antiproliferative agents from plants, we extended our interest on further compounds isolated from Ferula communis, Ferulago campestris. One new daucane (DE-20), one new phenol derivative (PH-3) were isolated, characterized in addition to six daucane, three coumarins, four simple phenolics. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated against a panel of six human tumor cell lines. The derivative DE-17 that resulted moderately active on all the studied cell lines was studied to evaluate its possible mechanism of action. DE-17 was able to induce apoptosis in a time, concentration-dependent manner in SEM, Jurkat cell lines. We observed that DE-17 just aftesr1h of treatment increased the ros (ROS) production, that the co-incubation of DE-17 with ROS scavengers significantly increased cell viability suggesting that ROS-mediated downstream signaling is essential for the antiproliferative effects of DE-17. At later times of incubation DE-17 induced mitochondrial depolarization, as well as caspase-3, -9 activation suggesting that apoptosis follow the mitochondrial pathway. Concomitantly to ROS induction, a remarkable decrease of mRNA expression of several antioxidant enzymes, intracellular GSH content was detected in treated cells compared to controls further indicative of oxidative stress. Taken together our results showed for the first time that daucane esters induces apoptotic cell death through a ROS-mediated mechanism in human leukemia cells.Novel chalcone derivatives as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF 1 inhibitor: synthesis, anti-invasive, anti-angiogenic properties. A novel series of chalcone derivatives were synthesized, their biological activities against HIF-1 were evaluated. Among these compounds, 5d exhibited clearly inhibitory effects on HIF-1 by downregulating the expression of HIF-1alpha under hypoxic conditions. Meanwhile, it also significantly suppressed VEGF-induced migration, invasion of Hep3B, HUVEC cells in nontoxic concentrations. Additionally, tube formation assay demonstrated its anti-angiogenesis activity. Moreover, the in? vivo study indicated that compound 5d could retard tumor growth of Hep3B xenograft models, reduced CD31, MMP-2 expression in tumor tissues. Finally, in acute intravenous toxicity, 5d was well tolerated, was found to be non-toxic up to 200? mg kg in Swiss mice. These findings support the further investigation on the anti-invasive, anti-angiogenic potential of this class of compounds as HIF-1 inhibitor. Anthraquinone-chalcone hybrids: synthesis, preliminary antiproliferative evaluation, DNA-interaction studies. Novel anthraquinone based chalcone compounds were synthesized starting from 1-acetylanthraquinone in a Claisen-Schmidt reaction, evaluated for their anticancer potential against three human cancer cell lines. Compounds 4a, 4b, 4j showed promising activity in inhibition of HeLa cells with IC50 values ranging from 2.36 to 2.73 ??M, low cytotoxicity against healthy MRC-5 cell lines. The effects that compounds produces on the cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry. It was found that 4a, 4b, 4j cause the accumulation of cells in the S, G2 M phases in a dose-dependent manner, induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. All of three compounds exhibit calf thymus DNA-binding activity. The determined binding constants by absorption titrations (2.65 ?? 10(3) M, 1.36 ?? 10(3) Mand 2.51 ?? 10(3) M of 4a CT-DNA, 4b CT-DNA, 4j CT-DNA, respectively) together with fluorescence displacement analysis designate 4a, 4b, 4j as strong minor groove binders.2-Hydroxy-3,4-naphthochalcone (2H-NC) inhibits TNFalpha-induced tumor invasion through the downregulation of NF-kB-mediated MMP-9 gene expression. The control of tumor metastasis is important for the successful prevention, treatment of cancer. Emerging evidence indicates that various natural, synthetic chalcones exhibit antimetastatic activity through the inhibition of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), although the precise mechanism by which this occurs is currently unclear. In this study, 2-hydroxy-3,4-naphthochalcone (2H-NC) was found to reduce tnf (TNFalpha induced MMP-9 mRNA expression, gelatinolytic enzyme activity. These actions were associated with inhibition of RelA p65 NF-kB activity. In addition, 2H-NC inhibited TNFalpha-induced invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, as assessed using a three-dimensional spheroid invasion assay. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 2H-NC prevents TNFalpha-induced tumor cell invasion through downregulation of NF-kB-mediated MMP-9 gene expression,, thereby identify naphthochalcones as a potentially effective class of molecules to use as a platform for the development of antimetastatic agents.Estradiol agonists inhibit human LoVo colorectal-cancer cell proliferation, migration through p53. To investigate the effects of 17beta-estradiol via esr1s (ER) or direct administration of ER agonists on human colorectal cancer. LoVo cells were established from the Bioresource Collection, Research Center, cultured in phenol red-free DMEM (Sigma, United States). To investigate the effects of E2, or ER selective agonists on cellular proliferation, LoVo colorectal cells were treated with E2 or ER-selective agonists for 24 h, 48 h, subjected to the MTT (Sigma) assay to find the concentration. And investigate the effects of E2, or ER selective agonists on cell used western immunoblotting to find out the diversification of signaling pathways. In order to observe motility, migration the wound healing assay, a transwell chamber (Neuro Probe) plate were tased. For a quantitative measure, we counted the number of migrating cells to the wound area post-wounding for 24 h. We further examined the cellular migration-regulating factors urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP 9 in human LoVo cells so gelatin zymography that we used, gelatinolytic activity was visualized by Coomassie blue staining. And these results are presented as means ?? SE,, statistical comparisons were made using Student\\'s t-test. The structure was first compared with E2, ER agonists. We then treated the LoVo cells with E2, ER agonists (10(-8) mol L) for 24 h, 48 h, subsequently measured the cell viability using MTT assay. Our results showed that treatment with 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonists in human LoVo colorectal cancer cells activated p53, then up-regulated p21, p27 protein levels, subsequently inhibiting the downstream target gene, cyclin D1, which regulates cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the anti-tumorigenesis effects of 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonists, suggest that these compounds may prove to be a potential alternative therapy in the treatment of human colorectal cancer. These results demonstrate that 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonists downregulate migration-related proteins through the p53 signaling pathway in human LoVo colorectal cancer cells. These findings suggest that p53 plays a critical role in the 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonist-mediated protective activity against colorectal cancer progression. In addition, 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonists dramatically inhibited cell migration, reduced the expression of u-PA, t-PA, MMP-9 as well as MMP-2 9 activity in LoVo cells, which regulate cell metastasis. Moreover, we observed that pretreatment with a p53 inhibitor significantly blocked the anti-migration effects of E2, or ER agonists on LoVo cells. That E2, or ER agonists may impair LoVo cell migration by modulating migration-related factors via the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Direct ER treatment may prove to be an attractive alternative therapy in the treatment of human colorectal tumors in the future.Phenolic, carotenoid profiles, antiproliferative activity of foxtail millet. Commonly consumed foxtail millet varieties Jingu28, Jingu34 were compared in terms of phytochemical composition, antioxidant property,, antiproliferative activity. The cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) was evaluated based on HepG2 cell cultivation. Antiproliferative properties against HepG2, MDA cell were assayed by methylene blue assay. Total phenolic content (TPC) was 78.79, 114.22 mg gallic acid equiv 100 g DW in Jingu28, Jingu34. Both varieties contained ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid. Xanthophylls, zeaxanthin were also detected. Peroxyl radical scavenging capacity of the foxtail millet were 228.13 (Jingu28), 355.03 (Jingu34) ??mol of vitamin C equiv 100 g, respectively. CAA values of the foxtail millet varieties ranged from 1.52 to 8.97 ??mol quercetin equiv 100 g DW. The proliferation of MDA, HepG2 cancer cells were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to Jingu28, Jingu34 extractions.Obtaining from grape pomace an enzymatic extract with anti-inflammatory properties. Grape pomace, a winemaking industry by-product, is a rich source of bioactive dietary compounds. Using proteases we have developed an enzymatic process for obtaining a water-soluble extract (GP-EE) that contains biomolecules such as peptides, carbohydrates, lipids, polyphenols in soluble form. Of especial interest is its high polyphenol content (12%), of which 77% are flavonoids, 33% are phenolic acids. The present study evaluates in vitro the potential anti-inflammatory effect of GP-EE by monitoring the expression of inflammatory molecules on N13 microglia cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). GP-EE decreases the mRNA levels of the inflammatory molecules studied. The molecules under study were as follows: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tnf (TNF-alpha), interleukin-beta (IL-beta), the ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1(Iba-1), the Toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4), as well as the iNOS protein level in LPS-stimulated microglia. Our findings suggest that, as a result of its ability to regulate excessive microglial activation, GP-EE possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, acting as a chemopreventive agent, it may be of therapeutic interest in neurodegenerative diseases involving neuroinflammation. We can, therefore, propose GP-EE as a useful natural extract, one that would be beneficial to apply in the field of chemopreventive compounds.Recent trends of chalcones potentialities as antiproliferative, antiresistance agents. Chalcones are natural compounds found in plants, fruits, vegetables. This class of compounds has shown many biological activities including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antihypertensive, among others. In cancer, it has been reported that chalcones interfere in several points of the signal transduction pathways related to cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, apoptosis, the reversal of multidrug resistance. The large number of research articles, patents related to chalcones is already an indication of their importance as a lead class of compounds. This article gathers recent efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of chalcones, associated with their anticancer, anti resistance potential. Fenofibrate induces G0 G1 phase arrest by modulating the PPARalpha FoxO1 p27 kip pathway in human glioblastoma cells. Fenofibrate, a fibric acid derivative, is known to possess lipid-lowering effects. Although fenofibrate-induced ppar (PPARalpha) transcriptional activity has been reported to exhibit anticancer effects, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms behind the antiproliferative effects of fenofibrate in U87MG cells (human glioma cell line) using the WST-8 Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. Furthermore, we examined genome-wide gene expression profiles, molecular networks using the DAVID online software. Fenofibrate reduced the expression of 405 genes, increased the expression of 2280 genes. DAVID analysis suggested that fenofibrate significantly affected cell cycle progression, pathways involved in cancer, including the mTOR signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway. Results of flow cytometry analysis indicated that fenofibrate induced cell cycle G0 G1 arrest in U87MG cells. Furthermore, we identified the FoxO1-p27(kip) signaling axis to be involved in fenofibrate-induced cell cycle arrest. Our findings suggest that in addition to its known lipid-lowering effects, fenofibrate may be used as an antitumor agent in glioma therapy. Weichang\\'an, 5-fluorouracil suppresses colorectal cancer in a mouse model. To examine the effect of Weichang\\'an (WCA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on colorectal tumor, hepatic metastasis in a mouse model. Quantitative determination of hesperidin, the effective component in WCA decoction, was performed using HPLC. In vitro cytotoxicity of WCA was determined by treating HCT-116 cells with WCA diluents or serum extracted from rats that received WCA by oral gavage for 1 wk, MTT assays. Forty-eight nude mice received cecum implantation with tumor blocks subcutaneously amplified from human colon cancer cell line HCT-116. Mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups: control (CON), WCA, 5-FU, combination (WCA 5-FU). Pathological examination of tumors consisted of tissue sectioning, hematoxylin, eosin staining. Tumor weight, size were measured,, the number of metastatic lesions was counted. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was determined by ELISA. The expression levels of tumor genesis, metastasis-related proteins beta-catenin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP 7 were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting. Cell fractionation was used to investigate intracellular distribution of beta-catenin. Parenchymal tumors were palpable in the abdomens of nude mice 2 wk post-implantation, orthotopic tumor formation rate was 100% in all groups. 5-FU treatment alone significantly decreased tumor weight compared to the CON group (1.203??0.284 g vs 1.804??0.649 g, P<0.01). WCA treatment alone reduced the rate of metastasis (50% vs 100%, P<0.05). Combination treatment of WCA 5-FU was the most effective, reducing the tumor weight (1.140??0.464 g vs 1.804??0.649 g, P<0.01), size (1493.438??740.906 mm3 vs 2180.259??816.556 mm3, P<0.05), the rate of metastases (40% vs 100%, P<0.01),, serum CEA levels (31.263??7.421 ??g L vs 43.040??11.273 ??g L, P<0.05). Expression of beta-catenin, MMP-7 was decreased in drug-treated groups compared to controls, as detected using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, respectively. Cell fractionation assays revealed that nuclear translocation of beta-catenin was reduced by WCA, or 5-FU treatments. Combination of WCA with 5-FU significantly inhibited colon tumor growth, hepatic metastases. Decreased expression of beta-catenin, MMP-7 may be important.it is further demonstrated that p(TA) particles are as effective as cisplatin (a cancer drug) against A549 cancerous cells that both showed about 36, 34% cell viability, respectively whereas linear TA showed 66% cell viability at 37.5??gmL concentration. Above this concentration p(TA), cisplatin showed almost the same toxicity against A549 cancerous cells. Additionally, p(TA) particles are found to be much more biocompatible against L929 Fibroblast cells, about 84% cell viability in comparison to linear TA with about 53% at 75??gmL concentration. Phloretin ameliorates chemokines, ICAM-1 expression via blocking of the NF-kB pathway in the TNF-alpha-induced HaCaT human keratinocytes. Previous studies found that phloretin had anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory,, anti-tumor properties. In this study, we investigated whether phloretin could suppress the production of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM 1, chemokines through downregulation of the nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in TNF-alpha-stimulated HaCaT human keratinocytes. HaCaT cells were treated with phloretin, then the cells were stimulated by TNF-alpha. Phloretin treatment decreased the production of IL-6, IL-8, CCL5, MDC,, TARC. Phloretin decreased ICAM-1 protein, mRNA expression,, also suppressed the adhesion of monocyte THP-1 cells to inflammatory HaCaT cells. Phloretin inhibited NF-kB translocation into the nucleus, also suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt, MAPK signal. In addition, phloretin increased heme oxygenase-1 production in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that phloretin has anti-inflammatory effects to inhibit chemokines, ICAM-1 expressions through suppression of the NF-kB, MAPK pathways in human keratinocytes.Apoptosis induced by NAD depletion is inhibited by KN-93 in a CaMKII-independent manner. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of nicotinamide mononucleotide from nicotinamide (Nam) in the salvage pathway of mammalian NAD biosynthesis. Several potent NAMPT inhibitors have been identified, used to investigate the role of intracellular NAD, to develop therapeutics. NAD depletion induced by NAMPT inhibitors depolarizes mitochondrial membrane potential, causes apoptosis in a range of cell types. However, the mechanisms behind this depolarization have not been precisely elucidated. We observed that apoptosis of THP-1 cells in response to NAMPT inhibitors was reduced by the Ca calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN-93 via an unknown mechanism. The inactive analog of KN-93, KN-92, exhibited the same activity, but the CaMKII-inhibiting cell-permeable autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide II did not, indicating that the inhibition of THP-1 cell apoptosis was not dependent on CaMKII. In evaluating the mechanism of action, we confirmed that KN-93 did not inhibit decreases in NAD levels but did inhibit decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that KN-93 exerts inhibition upstream of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Further, qPCR analysis of the Bcl-2 family of proteins showed that Bim is efficiently expressed following NAMPT inhibition, that KN-92 did not inhibit this expression. The L-type Ca channel blockers verapamil, nimodipine partially inhibited apoptosis, indicating that part of this effect is dependent on Ca channel inhibition, as both KN-93, KN-92 are reported to inhibit L-type Ca channels. On the other hand, KN-93, KN-92 did not markedly inhibit apoptosis induced by anti-cancer agents such as etoposide, actinomycin D, ABT-737, or TW-37, indicating that the mechanism of inhibition is specific to apoptosis induced by NAD depletion. These results demonstrate that NAD depletion induces a specific type of apoptosis that is effectively inhibited by the KN-93 series of compoundsBisphenol A stimulates the epithelial mesenchymal transition of estrogen negative breast cancer cells via FOXA1 signals. Estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer are associated with increased risks for metastasis, high rates of recurrence. Our present study revealed that nanomolar bisphenol A (BPA), a typical endocrine disrupting chemical, promoted the in vitro migration, induced mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ER-breast cancer cells. PCR array revealed that BPA can down regulate 12, up regulate 2 genes involved in regulation of signal transduction, biological pathways of breast cancer. The down regulated genes included FOXA1, which is a key determinant of endocrine response, down regulated by BPA via a time dependent manner. Silencing of FOXA1 by siRNA triggered the EMT of SkBr3 cells. While over expression of FOXA1 abolished BPA induced EMT. Further, 10(-8) M BPA significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1 2, p38-MAPK,, Akt in SkBr3 cells, while only PI3K Akt inhibitor LY294002 attenuated the BPA induced down regulation of FOXA1, E-Cadherin (E-Cad). Over expression of Akt also suppressed FOXA1 expression in SkBr3 cells. It suggested that PI3K Akt mediated, at least partially, BPA induced EMT of ER-breast cancer cells. In summary, our data provided the first evidence that BPA can promote the EMT of ER-breast cancer cells through down regulation of FOXA1. Investigating the effect of gallium curcumin, gallium diacetylcurcumin complexes on the structure, function, oxidative stability of the peroxidase enzyme, their anticancer, antibacterial activities. Curcumin has a wide spectrum of biological, pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, anticancer activities. Complexation of curcumin with metals has gained attention in recent years for improvement of its stability. In this study, the effect of gallium curcumin, gallium diacetylcurcumin on the structure, function, oxidative stability of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme were evaluated by spectroscopic techniques. In addition to the enzymatic investigation, the cytotoxic effect of the complexes was assessed on bladder, MCF-7 breast cancer, LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell lines by MTT assay. Furthermore, antibacterial activity of the complexes against S. aureus, E. coli was explored by dilution test method. The results showed that the complexes improve activity of HRP, also increase its tolerance against the oxidative condition. After addition of the complexes, affinity of HRP for hydrogen peroxide substrate decreases, while the affinity increases for phenol substrate. Circular dichroism, intrinsic, synchronous fluorescence spectra showed that the enzyme structure around the catalytic heme group becomes less compact, also the distance between the heme group, tryptophan residues increases due to binding of the complexes to HRP. On the whole, it can be concluded that the change in the enzyme structure upon binding to the gallium curcumin, gallium diacetylcurcumin complexes results in an increase in the antioxidant efficiency, activity of the peroxidise enzyme. The result of anticancer, antibacterial activities suggested that the complexes exhibit the potential for cancer treatment.Apigenin Inhibits Growth of Breast Cancer Cells: The Role of ERalpha, HER2 neu. Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived compounds with an estrogen-like activity. In mammalians, phytoestrogens bind to the esr1 (ER), participate in the regulation of cell growth, gene transcription. There are several reports of the cytotoxic effects of phytoestrogens in different cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to measure the phytoestrogen activity against breast cancer cells with different levels of ER expression, to elucidate the molecular pathways regulated by the leader compound. Methods used in the study include immunoblotting, transfection with a luciferase reporter vector,, a MTT test. We demonstrated the absence of a significant difference between ER , ER- breast cancer cell lines in their response to cytotoxic stimuli: treatment with high doses of phytoestrogens (apigenin, genistein, quercetin, naringenin) had the same efficiency in ER-positive, ER-negative cells. Incubation of breast cancer cells with apigenin revealed the highest cytotoxicity of this compound on the contrary, naringenin treatment resulted in a low cytotoxic activity. It was shown that high doses of apigenin (50 ??M) do not display estrogen-like activity, can suppress ER activation by 17beta-estradiol. Cultivation of HER2-positive breast cancer SKBR3 cells in the presence of apigenin resulted in a decrease in HER2 neu expression, accompanied by cleavage of an apoptosis substrate PARP. Therefore, the cytotoxic effects of phytoestrogens are not associated with the steroid receptors of breast cancer cells. Apigenin was found to be the most effective phytoestrogen that strongly inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells, including HER2-positive ones. Phloretin induces apoptosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 cells via JNK1 2, p38 MAPK pathways. Phloretin (Ph) existing in apples, pears, various vegetables is known to have antitumor activities in several cancer cell lines. However, little is known about its effect on human lung cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to see whether Ph could induce apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells,, explore the possible underlying mechanism of action. We found that Ph markedly induced cell apoptosis of NSCLC cell line A549,, inhibited the migration of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The expression level of BAX, cleaved caspase-3, -9,, degraded form of PARP was increased, Bcl-2 was decreased after Ph treatment. In addition, the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK, ERK1 2, JNK1 2 was increased in a dose???dependent manner in parallel with Ph treatment. Inhibition of P38 MAPK, JNK1 2 by specific inhibitors significantly abolished the Ph-induced activation of the caspase-3, -9. In vivo tumor-suppression assay further indicated that Ph (20 mg kg) displayed a more significant inhibitory effect on A549 xenografts in tumor growth. All these findings indicate that Ph is able to inhibit NSCLC A549 cell growth by inducing apoptosis through P38 MAPK, JNK1 2 pathways,, therefore may prove to be an adjuvant to the treatment of NSCLC.Dietary Consumption of Black Raspberries or Their Anthocyanin Constituents Alters Innate Immune Cell Trafficking in Esophageal Cancer. Freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB), their component anthocyanins (AC),, a metabolite of BRB ACs, protocatechuic acid (PCA), inhibit the development of esophageal cancer in rats induced by the carcinogen, N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA). All three components reduce inflammation in the esophagus, in plasma. The present study determined the relation of changes in inflammatory markers to infiltration of innate immune cells into NMBA-treated esophagus. Rats were injected with NMBA (0.35 mg kg) for 5 weeks while on control diet. Following NMBA treatment, rats were fed diets containing 6.1% BRB powder, an AC-rich fraction of BRBs (3.8 ??mol g), or 500 ppm PCA. At weeks 15, 25,, 35, inflammatory biomarker expression in the plasma, esophagus was quantified,, infiltration of immune cells in the esophagus was examined. At all three time points, BRB, AC,, PCA similarly affected cytokine production in the esophagus, plasma of NMBA-treated rats, relative to the NMBA-only control. These included decreased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine ILbeta, increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10. Moreover, all three diets also increased the expression of IL12, a cytokine that activates both cytolytic natural killer, CD8( ) T cells. In addition, the three diets also decreased infiltration of both macrophages, neutrophils into the esophagus. Overall, our results suggest that another mechanism by which BRBs, ACs,, PCA inhibit NMBA-induced esophageal tumorigenesis is by altering cytokine expression, innate immune cell trafficking into tumor tissues.Identification of new highly selective inhibitors of the human ADP ATP carriers by molecular docking, in vitro transport assays. Mitochondrial carriers are proteins that shuttle a variety of metabolites, nucleotides, coenzymes across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial ADP ATP carriers (AACs) specifically translocate the ATP synthesized within mitochondria to the cytosol in exchange for the cytosolic ADP, playing a key role in energy production, in promoting cell viability, regulating mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. In Homo sapiens four genes code for AACs with different tissue distribution, expression patterns. Since AACs are dysregulated in several cancer types, the employment of known, new AAC inhibitors might be crucial for inducing mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Albeit carboxyatractyloside (CATR), bongkrekic acid (BKA) are known to be powerful, highly selective AAC inhibitors, able to induce mitochondrial dysfunction at molecular level, poisoning at physiological level, we estimated here for the first time their affinity for the human recombinant AAC2 by in vitro transport assays. We found that the inhibition constants of CATR, BKA are 4 nM, 2.0 ??M, respectively. For finding new AAC inhibitors we also performed a docking-based virtual screening of an in-house developed chemical library, we identified about 100 ligands showing high affinity for the AAC2 binding region. By testing 13 commercially available molecules, out of the 100 predicted candidates, we found that 2 of them, namely suramin, chebulinic acid, are competitive AAC2 inhibitors with inhibition constants 0.3 ??M, 2.1 ??M, respectively. We also demonstrated that chebulinic acid, suramin are highly selective AAC2 inhibitors, since they poorly inhibit other human mitochondrial carriers (namely ORC1, APC1, AGC1).Dihydrochalcone Compounds Isolated from Crabapple Leaves Showed Anticancer Effects on Human Cancer Cell Lines. Seven dihydrochalcone compounds were isolated from the leaves of Malus crabapples, cv. Radiant,, their chemical structures were elucidated by UV, IR, ESI-MS, ??H-NMR, (13)C-NMR analyses. These compounds, which include trilobatin (A1), phloretin (A2), 3-hydroxyphloretin (A3), phloretin rutinoside (A4), phlorizin (A5), 6\\'\\'-O-coumaroyl-4\\'-O-glucopyranosylphloretin (A6),, 3\\'\\'\\'-methoxy-6\\'\\'-O-feruloy-4\\'-O-glucopyranosyl-phloretin (A7), all belong to the phloretin class, its derivatives. Compounds A6, A7 are two new rare dihydrochalcone compounds. The results of a MTT cancer cell growth inhibition assay demonstrated that phloretin, these derivatives showed significant positive anticancer activities against several human cancer cell lines, including the A549 human lung cancer cell line, Bel 7402 liver cancer cell line, HepG2 human ileocecal cancer cell line,, HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. A7 had significant effects on all cancer cell lines, suggesting potential applications for phloretin, its derivatives. Adding a methoxyl group to phloretin dramatically increases phloretin\\'s anticancer activity. Phloretin increases the anti-tumor efficacy of intratumorally delivered heat-shock protein 70? kDa (HSP70) in a murine model of melanoma. Recombinant HSP70 chaperone exerts a profound anticancer effect when administered intratumorally. This action is based on the ability of HSP70 to penetrate tumor cells, extract its endogenous homolog. To enhance the efficacy of HSP70 cycling, we employed phloretin, a flavonoid that enhances the pore-forming activity of the chaperone on artificial membranes. Phloretin increased the efficacy of HSP70 penetration in B16 mouse melanoma cells, K-562 human erythroblasts this was accompanied with increased transport of the endogenous HSP70 to the plasma membrane. Importantly, treatment with HSP70 combined with phloretin led to the elevation of cell sensitivity to cytotoxic lymphocytes by 16-18? % compared to treatment with the chaperone alone. The incubation of K-562 cells with biotinylated HSP70, phloretin increased the amount of the chaperone released from cells, suggesting that chaperone cycling could trigger a specific anti-tumor response. We studied the effect of the combination of HSP70, phloretin using B16 melanoma, a novel method of HSP70-gel application. We found that the addition of phloretin to the gel reduced tumor weight almost fivefold compared with untreated mice, while the life span of the animals extended from 25 to 39? days. The increased survival was corroborated by the activation of innate, adaptive immunity interestingly, HSP70 was more active in induction of CD8 ? cell-mediated toxicity, gammaIFN production while phloretin contributed largely to the CD56 cell response. In conclusion, the combination of HSP70 with phloretin could be a novel treatment for efficient immunotherapy of intractable cancers such as skin melanoma.Chemical composition, antioxidant, antitumor, anticancer, cytotoxic effects of Psidium guajava leaf extracts. Context Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae) leaves are used in traditional medicines for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, other ailments. The current study explores scientific validation for this traditional medication. Materials, methods We used ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazil (DPPH) assays to estimate antioxidant activity of P. guajava leaf extracts (methanol, hexane, chloroform). Antitumor, in vivo cytotoxic activities were determined using potato disc assay (PDA), brine shrimp lethality assay, respectively. Three human carcinoma cell lines (KBM5, SCC4, U266) were incubated with different doses of extracts, the anticancer activity was estimated by MTT assay. NF-kB suppressing activity was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Chemical composition of the three extracts was identified by GC-MS. Total phenolic, flavonoid contents were measured by colorimetric assays. , discussions The order of antioxidant activity of three extracts was methanol, chloroform, hexane. The IC50 values ranged from 22.73 to 51.65 mL for KBM5 22.82 to 70.25 mL for SCC4, 20.97 to 89.55 mL for U266 cells. The hexane extract exhibited potent antitumor, cytotoxic activities. This extract also completely inhibited the TNF-alpha induced NF-kB activation in KBM5 cells. GC-MS results showed that pyrogallol, palmitic acid, vitamin E were the major components of methanol, chloroform, hexane extracts. We observed significant difference in total phenolic, flavonoid contents of different solvent extracts. The present study demonstrates that P. guajava leaf extracts play a substantial role against cancer, down-modulate inflammatory nuclear factor kB. Inhibitory effect of luteolin on the proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines induced by epidermal growth factor. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the proliferation of breast cancer cells induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in vitro. MTT assay was used to detect the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the proliferation of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells as well as the effect on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. Western blotting was used to detect the effects of luteolin on the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (Erk) 1 2, signal transducers, activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) in MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. The results showed that luteolin could significantly inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells,, the inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells was more prominent. Moreover, luteolin could inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. Western blotting results showed that luteolin, AG1478 (an inhibitor of EGFR signaling) could inhibit the expression of p-EGFR, p-STAT3 in MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. Luteolin, LY294002 (an inhibitor of Akt signaling), PD98059 (an inhibitor of Erk1 2 signaling) could inhibit the expression of p-Akt, p-Erk1 2 respectively in MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. Our data suggest that luteolin may inhibit EGF-induced activities of EGFR signaling pathway in human breast cancer cell lines,, PI3K Akt, MAPK Erk1 2, STAT3 signal pathways may be the major pathways that mediate the inhibitory effect of luteolin on EGFR signaling. Overall, our results may provide a theoretical foundation for the development of luteolin as anti-tumor drug. Disubstituted naphthyl beta-D-xylopyranosides: Synthesis, GAG priming,, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibition. Xylosides are a group of compounds that can induce glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain synthesis independently of a proteoglycan core protein. We have previously shown that the xyloside 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl)beta-D-xylopyranoside has a tumor-selective growth inhibitory effect both in vitro, in vivo,, that the effect in vitro was correlated to a reduction in histone H3 acetylation. In addition, GAG chains have previously been reported to inhibit histone acetyltransferases (HAT). To investigate if xylosides, or the corresponding xyloside-primed GAG chains, can be used as HAT inhibitors, we have synthesized a series of naphthoxylosides carrying structural motifs similar to the aromatic moieties of the known HAT inhibitors garcinol, curcumin,, studied their biological activities. Here, we show that the disubstituted naphthoxylosides induced GAG chain synthesis,, that the ones with at least one free phenolic group exhibited moderate HAT inhibition in vitro, without affecting histone H3 acetylation in cell culture.Capsaicin Inhibited Aggressive Phenotypes through Downregulation of Tumor-Associated NADH Oxidase (tNOX) by POU Domain Transcription Factor POU3F2. Capsaicin has been reported to preferentially inhibit the activity of tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX), which belongs to a family of growth-related plasma membrane hydroquinone oxidases in cancer transformed cells. The inhibitory effect of capsaicin on tNOX is associated with cell growth attenuation, apoptosis. However, no previous study has examined the transcriptional regulation of tNOX protein expression. Bioinformatic analysis has indicated that the tNOX promoter sequence harbors a binding motif for POU3F2, which is thought to play important roles in neuronal differentiation, melanocytes growth differentiation, tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that capsaicin-mediated tNOX downregulation, cell migration inhibition were through POU3F2. The protein expression levels of POU3F2, tNOX are positively correlated,, that overexpression of POU3F2 (and the corresponding upregulation of tNOX) enhanced the proliferation, migration, invasion in AGS (human gastric carcinoma) cells. In contrast, knockdown of POU3F2 downregulates tNOX,, the cancer phenotypes are affected. These findings not only shed light on the molecular mechanism of the anticancer properties of capsaicin, but also the transcription regulation of tNOX expression that may potentially explain how POU3F2 is associated with tumorigenesis. Anti-tumor activity of benzylideneacetophenone derivatives via proteasomal inhibition in prostate cancer cells. A number of some chalcone derivatives possess promising biological properties including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant,, anti-tumor activity. Although it has been shown that some derivatives of chalcone induce apoptosis in different kinds of cancer cells, the involved mechanism of action is not well defined. The purpose of this study is to investigate the primary target of a benzylideneacetophenone derivative (JC3), which is a synthetic compound derived from the chalcone family, in human cancer, using prostate cancer cells as a working model. Herein, we show that JC3 inhibits proteasomal activity as indicated by both in vitro, in cell-based assays. Especially, the JC3-dimer was more potent than monomer in the aspect of proteasome inhibition, which induced apoptosis significantly in the prostate cancer cells. Owing to the critical roles of the proteasome in the biology of human tumor progression, invasion,, metastasis, these findings give an important clue for the development of novel anti-tumor agents.Aminoglycoside-derived amphiphilic nanoparticles for molecular delivery. The development of effective drug carriers can lead to improved outcomes in a variety of disease conditions. Here, we describe the development of novel aminoglycoside-derived amphiphilic nanoparticles for drug delivery, with an eye towards ablation of cancer cells. mPEG-PAE nanoparticles were able to carry significant amounts of doxorubicin (DOX), presumably by means of hydrophobic interactions between the drug, the core. Cell-based studies indicated that mPEG-PAE nanoparticles, loaded with doxorubicin, were able to induce significant loss in viabilities of PC3 human prostate cancer, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer,, MB49 murine bladder cancer cells empty nanoparticles resulted in negligible losses of cell viability under the conditions investigated. Taken together, our results indicate that the mPEG-PAE nanoparticle platform is attractive for drug delivery in different applications, including cancer.Inhibition of Autophagy Enhances Curcumin United light irradiation-induced Oxidative Stress, Tumor Growth Suppression in Human Melanoma Cells. Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin carcinoma, which possesses fast propagating, highly invasive characteristics. Curcumin is a natural phenol compound that has various biological activities, such as anti-proliferative, apoptosis-accelerating impacts on tumor cells. Unfortunately, the therapeutical activities of Cur are severely hindered due to its extremely low bioavailability. In this study, a cooperative therapy of low concentration Cur combined with red united blue light irradiation was performed to inspect the synergistic effects on the apoptosis, proliferation, autophagy in human melanoma A375 cell. The results showed that red united blue light irradiation efficaciously synergized with Cur to trigger oxidative stress-mediated cell death, induce apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation. Meanwhile, Western blotting revealed that combined disposure induced the formation of autophagosomes. Conversely, inhibition of the autophagy enhanced apoptosis, obstructed cell cycle arrest, induced reversible proliferation arrest to senescence. These findings suggest that Cur combined with red united blue light irradiation could generate photochemo-preventive effects via enhancing apoptosis, triggering autophagy,, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy convert reversible arrested cells to senescence, therefore reducing the possibility that damaged cells might escape programmed death.Structure related effects of flavonoid aglycones on cell cycle progression of HepG2 cells: Metabolic activation of fisetin, quercetin by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Dietary flavonoids are abundant in the Plant Kingdom, they are extensively studied because of their manifold pharmacological activities. Recent studies highlighted that cell cycle arrest plays a key role in their antiproliferative effect in different tumor cells. However, structure-activity relationship of flavonoids is poorly characterized. In our study the influence of 18 flavonoid aglycones (as well as two metabolites) on cell cycle distribution was investigated. Since flavonoids are extensively metabolized by liver cells, HepG2 tumor cell line was applied, considering the potential metabolic activation inactivation of flavonoids. Our major observations are the followings: (1) Among the tested compounds diosmetin, fisetin, apigenin, lutelin,, quercetin provoked spectacular extent of G2 M phase cell cycle arrest. (2) Inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase enzyme by entacapone decreased the antiproliferative effects of fisetin, quercetin. (3) Geraldol, isorhamnetin (3\\'-O-methylated metabolites of fisetin, quercetin, respectively) demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative effect on HepG2 cells compared to the parent compounds. Based on these results, O-methylated flavonoid metabolites or their chemically modified derivatives may be suitable candidates of tumor therapy.Curcumin inhibits H2O2-induced invasion, migration of human pancreatic cancer via suppression of the ERK NF-kB pathway. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a natural polyphenol present in turmeric, possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, antitumor metastatic activities. However, the underlying mechanisms by which curcumin suppresses the metastasis of pancreatic cancer are still not fully elucidated. Our previous study demonstrated that a moderate amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is able to promote pancreatic cancer invasion. The aim of this study was to determine whether curcumin can suppress H2O2-induced tumor invasive, migratory abilities. Human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3, Panc-1 cells were exposed to H2O2 with or without curcumin or N-acetylcysteine (NAC a scavenger of free radicals). The effects of curcumin on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT assay. The intracellular ros? (ROS) was determined using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorecein diacetate. The cellular invasive, migratory abilities were analyzed using Transwell Matrigel invasion assay, wound healing assay, respectively. The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase? (MMP 2, MMP-9 were determined using qT-PCR, western blotting at mRNA, protein level. The activation of p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase? (ERK), p-nuclear factor-kB? (NF-kB) were measured by western blotting. Our data showed that curcumin inhibited cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Curcumin, NAC were able to inhibit H2O2-induced ROS production, reduce the migration, invasion,, decrease the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the H2O2???induced elevation of p-ERK, p-NF-kB in BxPC-3, Panc-1 cells were reduced by curcumin, NAC, PD? 98059 (an ERK inhibitor). These data indicate that curcumin suppresses pancreatic cancer migration, invasion through the inhibition of the ROS ERK NF-kB signaling pathway. This study suggests that curcumin may be a potential anticancer agent for pancreatic cancer.Halogenated naphthochalcones, structurally related naphthopyrazolines with antitumor activity. Three 3-(3-halo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl 1-(2-naphthyl)prop-2-en-1-ones 1, three structurally related 2-pyrazolines 2 were prepared, assessed in vitro for anticancer activity. The chalcones 1 were antiproliferative with low double-digit micromolar IC50 values against six tumor cell lines whereas the pyrazolines 2 showed low single-digit micromolar IC50 values against this panel. The pyrazolines inhibited ATP-binding cassette efflux transporters of types P-gp, BCRP while the chalcones inhibited selectively BCRP. All test compounds induced an accumulation of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells in the G2 M phase of the cell cycle, they interfered with the microtubule, F-actin dynamics, but only the chalcones induced apoptosis in 518A2 melanoma cells aftesr24h.Acryloylphenylcarboxamides: A New Class of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2) Modulators. Chalcones are easily synthesized natural precursors of secondary plant metabolites,, their derivatives show various biological activities including inhibition of ABC transporters. Especially, their role as inhibitors of ABCG2, the most recently discovered ABC transporter involved in multidrug resistance, inspired the synthesis of new structurally diverse derivatives. Therefore, we combined the typical chalcone moiety with several acid chlorides by using an amide linker at position 2\\', 3\\', or 4\\' on ring???A of the chalcone. The resulting 35 compounds covered a wide spectrum of substitution patterns, which allowed development of structure-activity relationships, to find the optimal structural features for further investigations. Synthesized acryloylphenylcarboxamides were investigated for their inhibitory activity against ABCG2, their behavior toward ABCB1, ABCC1. Furthermore, for the most promising compounds, their intrinsic cytotoxicity, their ability to reverse ABCG2-mediated multidrug resistance were determined.Preclinical validation of the small molecule drug quininib as a novel therapeutic for colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths. Molecularly targeted therapies (e.g. bevacizumab) have improved survival rates but drug resistance ultimately develops, newer therapies are required. We identified quininib as a small molecule drug with anti-angiogenic activity using in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo screening models. Quininib (2- (E 2-(Quinolin-2-yl) vinyl phenol), is a small molecule drug (molecular weight 283.75???g mol), which significantly inhibited blood vessel development in zebrafish embryos (p???<???0.001). In vitro, quininib reduced endothelial tubule formation (p???<???0.001), cell migration was unaffected by quininib, cell survival was reduced by quininib (p???<???0.001). Using ex vivo human CRC explants, quininib significantly reduced the secretions of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, ENA-78, GRO-alpha, TNF, IL-beta, MCP-1 ex vivo (all values p???<???0.01). Quininib is well tolerated in mice when administered at 50???mg kg intraperitoneally every 3 days, significantly reduced tumor growth of HT-29-luc2 CRC tumor xenografts compared to vehicle control. In addition, quininib reduced the signal from a alphavbeta3 integrin fluorescence probe in tumors 10 days after treatment initiation, indicative of angiogenic inhibition. Furthermore, quininib reduced the expression of angiogenic genes in xenografted tumors. Collectively, these findings support further development of quininib as a novel therapeutic agent for CRC.Design, synthesis, cytotoxic activity of certain novel chalcone analogous compounds. A series of chalcone analogous compounds were designed, synthesized. Replacing substituting the enone or ethylenic bridge of the parent chalcone with rigid heterocyclic moieties or substituted aromatic amines gave nineteen target compounds. Their cytotoxic activities were screened against both breast, liver cancer cells as well as breast, liver normal cells. Target compounds were also evaluated for their inhibition activity of tubulin beta polymerization. Target compound 2e, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a-4d, 5a, 5b, 6 showed broad spectrum excellent anticancer activity against both MCF-7, HepG2. Compound 4a showed the most TUBb inhibition activity.Design, synthesis, activity of novel sorafenib analogues bearing chalcone unit. Two series of sorafenib derivatives (N-methylpicolinamide-4-oxy) chalcones (5a-o, 7a-e) were synthesized, characterized by NMR, MS. All of the target compounds were evaluated for the cytotoxicity against A549, HepG2, MCF-7,, PC-3 cancer cell lines, some selected compounds were further evaluated for the activity against VEGFR-2 KDR, BRAF kinases. The results indicated that all the compounds showed moderate to good antitumor activity,, the compound 5c showed well cytotoxic activity against HepG2, MCF-7, PC-3 cell lines with IC50 values of 0.56??0.83??M, 3.88??1.03??M, 3.15??0.81??M, which were 1.03-6.14-fold more active than sorafenib (3.44??1.50??M, 3.18??1.43??M, 3.24??0.45??M), respectively. The compound 5b showed good activity on VEGFR-2 KDR kinase,, its IC50 value was 0.72??M. Structure-activity relationships (SARs), docking studies indicated that replacement of urea group of sorafenib by chalcone ketones improved the cytotoxic activity,, the results suggested that halogen 3-Br, 4-F , methoxy (substituted on C-3,4,5 or C-2,3,4 position) substitution was benefit for the activity.Molecular Mechanisms of Anti-metastatic Activity of Curcumin. Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Although cancer occurs as a localized disease, its morbidity, mortality rates remain high due to the ability of cancer cells to break-off from the primary tumor, spread to distant organs. Currently, chemotherapy is the main treatment for cancer however, the increase in proportion of drug-resistant cancer cells, unpleasant side-effects of chemotherapy are still the major challenges in cancer therapy. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol compound, the main bioactive constituent of Indian spice turmeric, widely used in Indian, Chinese medicines. Curcumin has well-known therapeutic actions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer properties. Curcumin induces cancer cell apoptosis through regulating various signaling pathways, arresting tumor cell cycle. Curcumin\\'s therapeutic preventative actions on metastatic cancers have not been yet fully understood, studied. The present review explores the potential anti-metastatic mechanisms of curcumin, including inhibition of transcription factors, their signaling pathways (e.g., NF-kB, ApP-1, STAT3), inflammatory cytokines (e.g., CXCL1, CXCL2, IL-6, IL-8), multiple proteases (e.g., uPA, MMPs), multiple protein kinases (e.g., MAPKs, FAK), regulation of miRNAs (e.g., miR21, miR181b), heat shock proteins (HLJ1). In addition, possible synergistic actions of combination therapy of curcumin with current chemotherapies are discussed in this review. Novel synthetic chalcones induce apoptosis in the A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells harboring a KRAS mutation. A series of novel chalcones were synthesized by the Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction of tetralones, 5- 6-indolecarboxaldehydes. Treatment of human lung cancer cell line harboring KRAS mutation (A549) with the chalcones induced dose-dependent apoptosis. Cell cycle analyses, Western blotting suggested the critical role of the chalcones in interrupting G2 M transition of cell cycle. SAR study demonstrated that substituent on the indole N atom significantly affects the anticancer activity of the chalcones, with methyl, ethyl providing the more active compounds (EC50: 110-200nM), Compound 1g was found to be >4-fold more active in the A549 cells (EC50: 110nM) than in prostate (PC3) or pancreatic cancer (CLR2119, PAN02) cells. Furthermore, compound 1l selectively induced apoptosis of lung cancer cells A549 (EC50: 0.55??M) but did not show measurable toxicity in the normal lung bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC) at doses as high as 10??M, indicating specificity towards cancer cells. Apoptotic effect of chalcone derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene in human breast cancer cells. A variety of chalcones have demonstrated cytotoxic activity toward several cancer cell lines. This study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of four chalcones derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene in human breast cancer cell lines. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with synthesized chalcones, the cytotoxicity was evaluated by tetrazolium dye (MTT), live dead,, DAPI assays. Chalcones significantly decreased MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells viability in vitro in a dose dependent manner. After 48h treatment, the IC50 values ranging from 5.52 to 34.23??M. Chalcone 3c displayed the highest cytotoxic activity from all the tested compounds. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were confirmed in the live dead assay. In addition, DAPI staining revealed that these compounds induce death by apoptosis. The data speculate that chalcone derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene may represent a source of therapeutic agents for human breast cancer. Capsaicin synergizes with camptothecin to induce increased apoptosis in human small cell lung cancers via the calpain pathway. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by excellent initial response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy with a majority of the patients showing tumor shrinkage, even remission. However, the challenge with SCLC therapy is that patients inevitably relapse, subsequently do not respond to the first line treatment. Recent clinical studies have investigated the possibility of camptothecin-based combination therapy as first line treatment for SCLC patients. Conventionally, camptothecin is used for recurrent SCLC, has poor survival outcomes. Therefore, drugs which can improve the therapeutic index of camptothecin should be valuable for SCLC therapy. Extensive evidence shows that nutritional compounds like capsaicin (the spicy compound of chili peppers) can improve the anti-cancer activity of chemotherapeutic drugs in both cell lines, animal models. Statistical analysis shows that capsaicin synergizes with camptothecin to enhance apoptosis of human SCLC cells. The synergistic activity of camptothecin, capsaicin is observed in both classical, variant SCLC cell lines and, in vivo, in human SCLC tumors xenotransplanted on chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) models. The synergistic activity of capsaicin, camptothecin are mediated by elevation of intracellular calcium, the calpain pathway. Our data foster hope for novel nutrition based combination therapies in SCLC.Design, Synthesis,, Biological Evaluation of Coupled Bioactive Scaffolds as Potential Anticancer Agents for Dual Targeting of Dihydrofolate Reductase, Thioredoxin Reductase. The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzymes are involved in the process of tumor cell growth, survival. The 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine scaffold is well-established as a useful scaffold for DHFR inhibition, while chalcones have been reported to be inhibitors of TrxR. In this study, 15 novel compounds designed by the structural combination of the 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine, chalcone scaffolds via a diether linker were successfully synthesized, characterized. All of the compounds demonstrated dual inhibition against DHFR, TrxR when they were assessed by in vitro enzyme assays. The compounds also exhibited antiproliferative activity against the MCF-7, HCT116 cells. The more potent analogs 14, 15 were found to inhibit cellular DHFR, TrxR activities in HCT116 cells. Therefore, this study provided compelling evidence that 14, 15 could exert their anticancer property via multitarget inhibition at the cellular level.Ascofuranone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response via NF-kappaB, AP-1, p-ERK, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-beta in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The natural fungal compound ascofuranone (5-chloro-3- (2E,6E 7- (2S 5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl -3-methyl-octa-2,6-dienyl -2,4-dihydroxy-6-methyl-benzaldehyde, MW 420.93) (AF) isolated from Ascochyta viciae has been known to promote cell cycle arrest, inhibit invasion of tumor cells. We have previously studied a structurally similar compound ascochlorin (ASC MW 404.93) with regard to its anti-inflammatory activity in LPS- stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In order to examine the relationship between the anti-inflammatory activities, the molecular differences between AF, ASC, the activity of AF is herein studied, because ASC has a unique trimethyl oxocyclohexyl structure, while AF has a unique dimethyl-oxo-tetrahydrofuran structure. AF dose-dependently inhibited the production of NO, iNOS, the COX-2 mRNA, protein levels in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, AF suppressed mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6,, IL-beta, as assessed by RT-PCR. AF (30-50 ??g ml) treatment clearly inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kB, AP-1 (p-c-Jun) from the cytosolic space. Phosphorylation of IkB, which functions to maintain the activity of NF-kB, was decreased by AF treatment. Moreover, AF suppressed the binding of NF-kB (p65). Inhibition of IkBa phosphorylation, degradation inhibits nuclear translocation of p65. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analysis also revealed that translocation of NF-kB, AP-1 (p-c-Jun) was decreased upon AF treatment. AF specifically decreased the expression level of p-ERK, but not the expression level of p-p38 or p-JNK. Given these results, we suggest that AF suppresses the inflammatory response by targeting p-ERK. This indicates that AF is a negative regulator of LPS-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-kB, AP-1 (p-c-Jun) in RAW 264.7 macrophages,, specifically it targets p-ERK. Therefore, AF, ASC exert their effects in different ways, most probably because their structural differences allow for specific recognition, inhibition of their target MAPKs. Our results further suggest that AF could be a natural bioactive compound useful for treating inflammation-mediated pathological diseases.Synthesis, biological evaluation of novel pyrazolic chalcone derivatives as novel hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutics. Despite having the second highest mortality associated with cancer, currently Sorafenib is the only FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agent available for liver cancer patients which can only improve survival for few months. In this study, various pyrazolic chalcone analogous compounds were synthesized, evaluated as potential chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Modifying the central pyrazole ring at the C(3 position with different heteroaryl rings, substituting the C(4 position of pyrazole with differently substituted chalcone moiety produced fouthy two variant compounds. For all these compounds, cytotoxicity was evaluated using sulforhodamine B assay, real time cell growth tracking, respectively. Based on 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, compounds 39, 42, 49,, 52 were shown to exhibit potent cytotoxic activity against all the cancer cell lines tested,, had better cytotoxic activities than the well-known chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU. Therefore, these compounds were chosen to be further evaluated in a panel of HCC cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis of HCC cells treated with compounds 39, 42, 49,, 52 demonstrated that these compounds caused cell cycle arrest at G2 M phase followed by the apoptotic cell death, impaired cell growth as shown by real-time cell growth surveillance. Consistent with these results, western blotting of HCC cells treated with the compounds resulted in molecular changes for cell cycle proteins, where p21 levels were increased independent of p53, the levels of the key initiators of mitosis Cyclin B1, CDK1 were shown to decrease upon treatment. In conclusion, chalcone derivatives 42, 52 show potent bioactivities by modulating the expression of cell-cycle related proteins, resulting in cell-cycle arrest in the HCC cell lines tested here, indicating that the compounds can be considered as preclinical candidates.Pentabromophenol suppresses TGF-beta signaling by accelerating degradation of type II TGF-beta receptors via caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Pentabromophenol (PBP), a brominated flame retardant (BFR), is widely used in various consumer products. BFRs exert adverse health effects such as neurotoxic, endocrine-disrupting effects. In this study, we found that PBP suppressed TGF-beta response by accelerating the turnover rate of TGF-beta receptors. PBP suppressed TGF-beta-mediated cell migration, PAI-1 promoter-driven reporter gene activation,, Smad2 3 phosphorylation in various cell types. Furthermore, PBP abolished TGF-beta-mediated repression of E-cadherin expression, in addition to the induction of vimentin expression, N-cadherin, fibronectin upregulation, thus blocking TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549, NMuMG cells. However, this inhibition was not observed with other congeners such as tribromophenol, triiodophenol. TGF-beta superfamily members play key roles in regulating various biological processes including cell proliferation, migration as well as cancer development, progression. The results of this in vitro study provide a basis for studies on the detailed relationship between PBP, modulation of TGF-beta signalling. Because PBP is similar to other BFRs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), additional laboratory, mechanistic studies should be performed to examine BFRs as potential risk factors for tumorigenesis, other TGF-beta-related diseases.TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 expressions, responsible for disparity in action of curcumin against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Cisplatin is a regularly employed effective chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of many types of cancer. The main drawback of cisplatin treatment is kidney toxicity which affects 25-35% of treated patients. Many mechanisms are believed to be involved in this kidney damage, but inflammation plays a significant role in this event. Curcumin is a polyphenol, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the protective effects of curcumin on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Female rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control, curcumin, cisplatin, curcumin plus cisplatin (pre-treatment group), cisplatin plus curcumin (post-treatment group). Rats were given cisplatin (7.5? mg kg body weight) with or without curcumin treatment (120? mg kg body weight). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, tnf (TNF alpha, interleukin (IL beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 expressions, histological changes were determined on the 5th day after cisplatin injection. Acute kidney damage was evident by increased BUN, creatinine levels. In addition, cisplatin showed a marked pro-inflammatory response as revealed by a significant increase in the tissue levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, decrease in the IL-10 level. Pre-treatment of curcumin reduced cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity which was clearly evident from the reduced BUN, creatinine, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 levels, increased albumin, IL-10 levels. Additionally, these findings were also supported by histopathology of the kidneys. In contrast, post-treatment of curcumin failed to cut down the expression of inflammatory markers substantially, also neglected to increase the expression of IL-10. The disparity in the action of curcumin after pre-, post-treatment with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was due to the inability of post-treatment to reduce TNF-alpha IL-6, besides to show a concurrent rise in IL-10 expression in renal tissues.Induction of G2M Arrest by Flavokawain A, a Kava Chalcone, Increases the Responsiveness of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer Cells to Herceptin. HER2 neu positive breast tumors predict a high mortality, comprise 25%-30% of breast cancer. We have shown that Flavokawain A (FKA) preferentially reduces the viabilities of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (i.e., SKBR3, MCF7 HER2) versus those with less HER2 expression (i.e., MCF7, MDA-MB-468). FKA at cytotoxic concentrations to breast cancer cell lines also has a minimal effect on the growth of non-malignant breast epithelial MCF10A cells. FKA induces G2M arrest in cell cycle progression of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines through inhibition of Cdc2, Cdc25C phosphorylation, downregulation of expression of Myt1, Wee1 leading to increased Cdc2 kinase activities. In addition, FKA induces apoptosis in SKBR3 cells by increasing the protein expression of Bim, BAX, decreasing expression of Bcl???, BclX L, XIAP,, survivin. FKA also downregulates the protein expression of HER-2, inhibits AKT phosphorylation. Herceptin plus FKA treatment leads to an enhanced growth inhibitory effect on HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines through downregulation of Myt1, Wee1, Skp2, survivin,, XIAP. Our results suggest FKA as a promising, novel apoptosis inducer, G2 blocking agent that, in combination with Herceptin, enhances for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.Combination of ABT-737, resveratrol enhances DNA damage, apoptosis in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells. ABT-737 belongs to a new class of anticancer agents named BH3 mimetics. ABT-737 competitively binds to surface hydrophobic grooves of anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family, counteracting their protective effect. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, or induce apoptosis in a number of different types of cancer cells. The present study was designed to analyze the combined effects of ABT-737, resveratrol on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of these agents against MOLT-4 leukemia cells was determined using the Coulter electrical impedance method, comet assay,, flow cytometry, light microscopy, western blot techniques. The results are the first data showing that ABT-737 combined with resveratrol markedly decreased the cell viability, increased DNA damage, caused the cell cycle perturbation,, synergistically enhanced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells, when compared to the data obtained after application of the single agent. Moreover, the simultaneous treatment of leukemia cells with ABT-737, resveratrol resulted in a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase of p53 protein level, up-regulation of the Bax Bcl-2 ratio. The obtained data indicate that the combination of ABT-737, resveratrol is a promising approach for acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment that should be further explored. Novel 3\\',5\\'-diprenylated chalcones inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in? vitro by inducing cell apoptosis, arresting cell cycle phase. A double Claisen rearrangements synthetic strategy was established for the total synthesis of 4,4\\'-dimethyl medicagenin (compound 6c). A series of its analogs also were prepared, including two novel 3\\',5\\'-diprenylated chalcones, in which ring B was replaced by azaheterocycle. The structures of the twenty-two newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ESI-MS. In? vitro, the cytotoxicity of the target compounds was evaluated using cancer cells. Noticeably, compound 10 exhibited broad-spectrum cytotoxicity on PC3 prostate cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA), HEL, K562 erythroleukemia cells with IC50 values of 2.92, 3.14, 1.85, 2.64? ??M, respectively. Further studies indicated that compound 10 induced apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle phase of the above mentioned four cancer cell lines. By contrast, compound 6g selectively displayed potent inhibitory activity against the proliferation of HEL cells with an IC50 value of 4.35? ??M. Compound 6g slightly induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle phase of HEL cells. Preliminary structure-activity relationship studies indicated that, in all cancer cell lines evaluated, the 3-pyridinyl group was essential for cytotoxicity.Ginkgolic acids inhibit migration in breast cancer cells by inhibition of NEMO sumoylation, NF-kB activity. Ginkgolic acids (GA), a group of alkyl phenols found in crude extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves, are known to have anticancer activity, but their mode of action is not well understood. Our aim in this study was to investigate the anti-migratory activity of seven GA against breast cancer cells, to determine the molecular mechanism behind this activity. All seven GA, their mixture inhibited wound healing in MCF-7, MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. None of the compounds nor the mixture showed cytotoxicity towards the two cell lines, if tested by the resazurin assay. C13:0 inhibited NF-kB activity in the HEK Blue Null 1 reporter cell line. Furthermore, C13:0 inhibited degradation of nuclear factor of k-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IkBalpha). Sumoylation assay revealed that GA inhibited sumoylation of NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO). Molecular docking on SUMO-activating enzyme E1 showed that the seven GA bound to the active adenylation site with high calculated affinities ranging from -10.28 to -12.27 kcal mol. Quantitative RT-PCR using C15:0, C13:0, the mixture showed a significant down-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). We conclude that GA revealed considerable anti-migratory activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations, indicating anti-metastatic activity with low toxicity. This effect can be explained by the inhibition of NEMO sumoylation leading to inhibition of IkBalpha degradation, consequently a reduction of NF-kB activity, leading to the down-regulation of metastasis related genes including uPA, PAI-1, CXCR4,, MMP-9.Bisphenol A activates EGFR, ERK promoting proliferation, tumor spheroid formation, resistance to EGFR pathway inhibition in esr1-negative inflammatory breast cancer cells. Emerging evidence from epidemiological studies suggests a link between environmental chemical exposure, progression of aggressive breast cancer subtypes. Of all clinically distinct types of breast cancers, the most lethal phenotypic variant is inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR HER2) along with esr1 (ER) negativity is common in IBC tumor cells, which instead of a solid mass present as rapidly proliferating diffuse tumor cell clusters. Our previous studies have demonstrated a role of an adaptive response of increased antioxidants in acquired resistance to EGFR-targeting drugs in IBC. Environmental chemicals are known to induce oxidative stress resulting in perturbations in signal transduction pathways. It is therefore of interest to identify chemicals that can potentiate EGFR mitogenic effects in IBC. Herein, we assessed in ER-negative IBC cells a subset of chemicals from the EPA ToxCast set for their effect on EGFR activation, in multiple cancer phenotypic assays. We demonstrated that endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA), 2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl 1,1,1-trichloroethane can increase EGFR ERK signaling. BPA also caused a corresponding increase in expression of SOD1, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, key markers of antioxidant, anti-apoptotic processes. BPA potentiated clonogenic growth, tumor spheroid formation in vitro, reflecting IBC-specific pathological characteristics. Furthermore, we identified that BPA was able to attenuate the inhibitory effect of an EGFR targeted drug in a longer-term anchorage-independent growth assay. These findings provide a potential mechanistic basis for environmental chemicals such as BPA in potentiating a hyperproliferative, death-resistant phenotype in cancer cells by activating mitogenic pathways to which the tumor cells are addicted for survival. The protective effect of propofol against TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis was mediated via inhibiting iNOS NO production, maintaining intracellular Ca2 homeostasis in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. Inflammation cytokine tnf (TNF-alpha) induces apoptosis in neuronal cells. We hypothesized that propofol may attenuate TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells, aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Mouse hippocampal HT22 cells were pretreated with propofol,, then stimulated with TNF-alpha. Cell viability was measured by cell counting kit 8 (CCK8). Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry analysis. The effect of propofol on TNF-alpha-modulated nitric oxide production was measured by a nitrate reductase assay kit, intracellular calcium release, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization were measured by flow cytometry analysis,, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), C EBP homologous protein (CHOP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family, caspases were detected by Western blot. Compared with control, TNF-alpha concentration-, time-dependently increased HT22 cell apoptosis, which was attenuated by 25??mol l propofol. TNF-alpha (40ng ml, 24h) induced the overexpression of iNOS, the release of nitric oxide, caused the accumulation of intracellular Ca2 , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,, therefore leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, these effects were alleviated by 25??mol l propofol. We demonstrated that propofol could attenuate TNF-alpha-induced HT22 apoptosis. More importantly, we indicated that the underlying mechanism may involve iNOS NO, Ca2 , mitochondrial dysfunction. Identification of a novel chalcone derivative that inhibits Notch signaling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Notch signaling is considered a rational target in the therapy of several cancers, particularly those harbouring Notch gain of function mutations, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We have designed, synthetized the chalcone-derivative 8 possessing Notch inhibitory activity at low micro molar concentration in T-ALL cell lines. Structure-activity relationships were afforded for the chalcone scaffold. Short term treatments with compound 8 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of Notch signaling activity, halted cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis, thus affecting leukemia cell growth. Taken together, our data indicate that 8 is a novel Notch inhibitor, against Notch-dependent cancers.A Benzylideneacetophenone Derivative Induces Apoptosis of Radiation-Resistant Human Breast Cancer Cells via Oxidative Stress. Benzylideneacetophenone derivative (1E 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) hept-1-en-3-one (JC3) elicited cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells-radiation resistant cells (MDA-MB 231-RR), in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 6 ??M JC3. JC3-mediated apoptosis was confirmed by increase in sub-G1 cell population. JC3 disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential,, reduced expression of anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma-2 protein, whereas it increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein, leading to the cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In addition, JC3 activated mitogen-activated protein kinases,, specific inhibitors of these kinases abrogated the JC3-induced increase in apoptotic bodies. JC3 increased the level of intracellular ros, enhanced oxidative macromolecular damage via lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation,, DNA strand breakage. Considering these findings, JC3 is an effective therapy against radiation-resistant human breast cancer cells.Cytotoxic effect of a novel naphthylchalcone against multiple cancer cells focusing on hematologic malignancies. Chalcones are natural compounds described in the literature by its several properties including cytotoxic activity against several tumor types. Considering that the search for new chemotherapeutic agents is still necessary, the aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic mechanisms involved in cell death induced by a synthetic chalcone (A23) on different tumor cells. Chalcone A23 reduced the cell viability of twelve tumor cell lines in a concentration, time dependent manner, it was more cytotoxic against acute leukemia cells. Interestingly, the compound was non cytotoxic to normal cells, non-hemolytic to normal red blood cells. Chalcone A23 decreased the expression of cell proliferation marker KI-67, blocked the G2 M phase in both K562, Jurkat cell lines. Cells treated with A23 showed morphological features suggestive of apoptosis, the latter pattern in agarose gel, the externalization of phosphatidylserine, caspase-3, PARP cleavage. Chalcone A23 significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, survivin, increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, confirming the involvement of the intrinsic pathway. The increased mitochondrial permeability resulted in the release of AIF, cytochrome c, endonuclease G from the mitochondria to the cytosol. In addition, chalcone A23 increased the expression of FasR, induced Bid cleavage, showing the involvement of the extrinsic pathway. Finally, chalcone A23 seems to have a synergic effect with the chemotherapy drugs cytarabine, vincristine. These results suggest that A23 is an interesting compound with strong, selective anti-tumor activity. Anticancer activity of hydroxy-, sulfonamide-azobenzene platinum(II) complexes in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. The anticancer activities of these complexes were evaluated in wild-type (A2780), cisplatin-resistant (A2780CP70) ovarian cancer cells. All three complexes exhibited IC50 values below 10??M, displayed similar activity in both A2780, A2780CP70 cell lines, indicating that they are not cross-resistant with cisplatin.Synthesis, structures, nuclease activity, cytotoxicity, DFT, molecular docking studies of two nitrato bridged homodinuclear (Cu-Cu, Zn-Zn) complexes containing 2,2\\'-bipyridine, a chalcone derivative. The co-ligand L binds the metal ions through its O,O\\' atoms in anti-syn mode. The metal centers in complexes 1, 2 are separated via bridging nitrato group at a distance of 6.073??, 5.635?? respectively. Their structures, absorption spectra are supported by the computational studies using density functional theory (DFT), TD-DFT. Both complexes exhibit nuclease activity, cleave supercoiled (form I) DNA. The complex 1 preferentially binds major groove of DNA, follows an oxidative pathway whereas complex 2 binds with minor groove of DNA via hydrolytic pathway. Both complexes inhibit topoisomerase I relaxation activity with IC50 values of 7, 35??M. Molecular docking studies support the groove binding, topoisomerase I binding of the complexes. The complex 1 showed a significant cytotoxicity against HeLa cell lines (a cervical cancer cell lines) in vitro with IC50 value calculated as 2.9??0.021??M as compared to 28.2??0. 044???? for complex 2. Complex 2 induces the cell apoptosis at a later-stage as compared to complex 1. The cell apoptosis, topoisomerase inhibition by complexes enable them to be potential candidates as future anticancer drugs. Sechium edule (Jacq.) Swartz, a New Cultivar with Antiproliferative Potential in a Human Cervical Cancer HeLa Cell Line. The Sechium edule Perla Negra cultivar is a recently-obtained biological material whose progenitors are S. edule var. nigrum minor, S. edule var. amarus silvestrys, the latter of which has been reported to have antiproliferative activity against the HeLa P-388, L-929 cancer cell lines. The present study aimed to determine if the methanolic extract of the fruit of the Perla Negra cultivar had the same biological activity. The methanolic extract was phytochemically characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC), column chromatography (CC), identifying the terpenes, flavonoids. The compounds identified via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were Cucurbitacins B, D, E,, I for the terpene fractions,, Rutin, Phlorizidin, Myricetin, Quercetin, Naringenin, Phloretin, Apigenin,, Galangin for the flavonoid fractions). Biological activity was evaluated with different concentrations of the methanolic extract in the HeLa cell line, normal lymphocytes. The methanolic extract inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells (IC50 1.85 ??g??mL-1), but the lymphocytes were affected by the extract (IC50 30.04 ??g??mL-1). Some fractions,, the pool of all of them, showed inhibition higher than 80% at a concentration of 2.11 ??g??mL-1. Therefore, the biological effect shown by the methanolic extract of the Perla Negra has some specificity in inhibiting tumor cells, not normal cells an unusual feature among molecules investigated as potential biomedical agents.Centella asiatica modulates cancer cachexia associated inflammatory cytokines, cell death in leukaemic THP-1 cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC\\'s). Cancer cachexia is associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Centella asiatica (C. asiatica) possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor potential. We investigated the modulation of antioxidants, cytokines, cell death by C. asiatica ethanolic leaf extract (CLE) in leukaemic THP-1 cells, normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC\\'s). Cytotoxcity of CLE was determined at 24, 72? h (h). Oxidant scavenging activity of CLE was evaluated using the 2, 2-diphenyl-1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Glutathione (GSH) levels, caspase (-8, -9, -3 7) activities, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels (Luminometry) were then assayed. The levels of tnf (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL 6, IL-beta, IL-10 were also assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. CLE decreased PBMC viability between 33.25-74.55% (24? h: 0.2-0.8? mg ml CLE, 72? h: 0.4-0.8? mg ml CLE), THP-1 viability by 28.404% (72? h: 0.8? mg ml CLE) (p? <? 0.0001). Oxidant scavenging activity was increased by CLE (0.05-0.8? mg ml) (p? <? 0.0001). PBMC TNF-alpha, IL-10 levels were decreased by CLE (0.05-0.8? mg ml) (p? <? 0.0001). However, PBMC IL-6, IL-beta concentrations were increased at 0.05-0.2? mg ml CLE but decreased at 0.4? mg ml CLE (p? <? 0.0001). In THP-1 cells, CLE (0.2-0.8? mg ml) decreased IL-beta, IL-6 whereas increased IL-10 levels (p? <? 0.0001). In both cell lines, CLE (0.05-0.2? mg ml, 24, 72? h) increased GSH concentrations (p? <? 0.0001). At 24? h, caspase (-9, -3 7) activities was increased by CLE (0.05-0.8? mg ml) in PBMC\\'s whereas decreased by CLE (0.2-0.4? mg ml) in THP-1 cells (p? <? 0.0001). At 72? h, CLE (0.05-0.8? mg ml) decreased caspase (-9, -3 7) activities, ATP levels in both cell lines (p? <? 0.0001). In PBMC\\'s, THP-1 cells, CLE proved to effectively modulate antioxidant activity, inflammatory cytokines, cell death. In THP-1 cells, CLE decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels whereas it increased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels which may alleviate cancer cachexia.A comparative assessment of antiproliferative properties of resveratrol, ethanol leaf extract of Anogeissus leiocarpus (DC) Guill, Perr against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. Epidemiological, experimental evidences have shown cancer as a leading cause of death worldwide. Although the folklore use of plants as a reliable source of health-restoring principles is well-documented, the search for more of such plants that are active against diseases, such as cancer, continues. We report here a laboratory-based evidence of the relevance of an ethanol leaf extract of Anogeissus leiocarpus (A2L) in comparison with resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, in cancer therapy. The quantitative assessment of flavonoid, phenolic contents involved quercetin, gallic acid as standards, respectively were determined using spectrophotometry. Cytotoxicity was determined fluorometrically using propidium-iodide-staining method. Antioxidant status, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, caspase activities, mitochondrial integrity were assessed using fluorometry luminometry. The antioxidant assay demonstrated that A2L possesses a strong antioxidant capacity as compared with the reference compounds, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene. This is further buttressed by the significantly high level of phenolics obtained in the quantitative assessment of the extract. A 72-h post-treatment examination indicated that both A2L, resveratrol modulate the proliferation of HepG2 liver carcinoma cells in a time-, concentration-dependent manner. Determination of the total nuclei area, propidium-iodide negative, positive nuclei areas all further buttress the modulation of cell proliferation by A2L, resveratrol with the indication that the observed cell death is due to apoptosis, necrosis at lower, higher concentrations of treatments respectively. At lower concentrations (0.39-3.13? ??g mL), resveratrol possesses higher tendencies to activate caspases 3, 7. Assessment of 24-h post-treatment mitochondrial function shows that resveratrol is not mitotoxic as compared with A2L which exhibits mitotoxicity at its highest concentration. Taken together, findings from this study showed that A2L possesses strong antiproliferative activity, its prospect in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma deserves further investigation.Induction of Apoptosis, Cell Cycle Arrest by Flavokawain C on HT-29 Human Colon Adenocarcinoma via Enhancement of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation, Upregulation of p21, p27,, GADD153,, Inactivation of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins. Chalcones have been shown to exhibit anti-cancer properties by targeting multiple molecular pathways. It was, therefore, of interest to investigate flavokawain C (FKC), a naturally occurring chalcone, which can be isolated from Kava (Piper methysticum Forst) root extract. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of FKC on the growth of HT-29 cells, its underlying mechanism of action. Cell viability of HT-29 cells was assessed by Sulforhodamine B assay after FKC treatment. Induction of apoptosis was examined by established morphological, biochemical assays. ROS generation was determined by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence staining,, superoxide dismutase activity was measured using the spectrophotometric method. Western blotting was used to examine the changes in the protein levels. FKC markedly decreased the cell viability of HT-29 cells, the cells showed dramatic changes in cellular, nuclear morphologies with typical apoptotic features. The induction of apoptosis correlated well with the externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspases,, PARP cleavage. This was associated with an increase in ros, a decrease in SOD activity. The protein levels of XIAP, c-IAP1,, c-IAP2 were downregulated, whereas the GADD153 was upregulated after FKC treatment. FKC induced cell cycle arrest at the G1, G2 M phases via upregulation of p21, p27 in a p53-independent manner. Our results provide evidence that FKC has the potential to be developed into chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of colon adenocarcinoma. Flavokawain C inhibited the growth of HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells. Flavokawain C induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells, associated with an increase in ros, a decrease in SOD activity. Flavokawain C induced cell cycle arrest at the G1, G2 M phases via upregulation of p21, p27 in HT-29 cellsHT-29 cells treated with flavokawain C caused downregulation of XIAP, c-IAP1,, c-IAP2,, upregulation of GADD153.Novel quinolone chalcones targeting colchicine-binding pocket kill multidrug-resistant cancer cells by inhibiting tubulin activity, MRP1 function. Agents targeting colchicine-binding pocket usually show a minimal drug-resistance issue, albeit often associated with high toxicity. Chalcone-based compounds, which may bind to colchicine-binding site, are found in many edible fruits, suggesting that they can be effective drugs with less toxicity. Therefore, we synthesized, examined 24 quinolone chalcone compounds, from which we identified ((E 3-(3-(2-Methoxyphenyl 3-oxoprop-1-enyl) quinolin-2(1H one) (CTR-17), ((E 6-Methoxy-3-(3-(2-methoxyphenyl 3-oxoprop-1-enyl) quinolin-2(1H one) (CTR-20) as promising leads. In particular, CTR-20 was effective against 65 different cancer cell lines originated from 12 different tissues, largely in a cancer cell-specific manner. We found that both CTR-17, CTR-20 reversibly bind to the colchicine-binding pocket on beta-tubulin. Interestingly however, both the CTRs were highly effective against multidrug-resistant cancer cells while colchicine, paclitaxel, vinblastine were not. Our study with CTR-20 showed that it overcomes multidrug-resistance through its ability to impede MRP1 function while maintaining strong inhibition against microtubule activity. Data from mice engrafted with the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells showed that both CTR-17, CTR-20 possess strong anticancer activity, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, without causing any notable side effects. Together, our data demonstrates that both the CTRs can be effective, safe drugs against many different cancers, especially against multidrug-resistant tumors.Anticarcinogenic activity of Muntingia calabura leaves methanol extract against the azoxymethane-induced colon cancer in rats involved modulation of the colonic antioxidant system partly by flavonoids. Leaves of Muntingia calabura (Elaeocarpaceae) are widely used in traditional medical practice scientific findings show various pharmacological activities. However, its anticancer effect has not been investigated thoroughly yet. The objective of this study is to study the chemoprevention effects of MEMCL against azoxymethane (AOM induced colon cancer, to examine the involvement of endogenous antioxidants Materials, methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into five groups (n???=???7), were injected intraperitoneally once weekly for 2???weeks with 15???mg kg AOM, except for the normal group (received saline). The animals were then administered orally for 8???weeks with 8% Tween-80 (vehicle normal group), 8% Tween-80 (vehicle cancer group) or, 50, 250 or 500???mg kg MEMC. After treatments, colon samples were collected from each rat for the histopathological analysis, quantification of aberrant crypt foci formed, determination of colon antioxidant levels. MEMC was also subjected to HPLC analysis. The extract exerted significant (p???<???0.05): anti-carcinogenesis activity, indicated by a decrease in the total aberrant crypt formation antioxidant activity by increasing the colon tissue antioxidant markers i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) , reducing the oxidant marker (i.e., malonaldehyde (MDA) levels in comparison with the cancer group. HPLC analysis demonstrated the presence of rutin. Muntingia calabura leaves exert anticancer effect against AOM-induced colon cancer possibly via the action of flavonoids on the colon tissue antioxidant activity.The Study of Apoptosis-inducing Effects of Three Pre-apoptotic Factors by Gallic Acid, Using Simulation Analysis, the Comet Assay Technique on the Prostatic Cancer Cell Line PC3. In this study, we demonstrated the effects of the Gallic Acid (GA) molecule on the prostate cancer cells line PC3 using the comet assay (Alkaline electrophoresis) technique, its effects on some important apoptotic factors including BAD (Bcl-2-Associated Death promoter), BAK (Bcl-2 homologous Antagonist Killer),, BIM (Bcl-2-like protein 11) via simulation analysis by using the Auto Dock, Gromacs software. Following the MTT assay on the PC3 cells,, determining IC50, we used three concentrations of GA to around IC50 to treat PC3 cells. 100 comet pictures were obtained by alkaline electrophoresis, have been analysed with the CASP version 1.2.2 software all the results were thereafter analysed by the SPSS version 21 statistical software. The IC50 value for GA was determined to be 35 ??M. The ratio of tail to head in alkaline electrophoresis for the three concentrations below the IC50 of GA in 25, 30,, 35 ??M were measured as 24.7 (2.7), 44.5 (1.8),, 57.3 (1.3) percent, respectively. The results of the preapoptotic factors (BAD, BAK,, BIM) in the performed simulation in the absence, presence of GA showed that the GA protein causes the structural instability in the BAD protein,, the effect of GA can be explained by the creation of hydrogen bonds with proteins. GA is a polyphenol compound in plants that can suppress cell growth, induce apoptosis in PC3 cells in prostate cancer in the range of IC50 concentrations. The apoptotic properties of GA induce pre-apoptotic factors.The effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the incident , recurrent risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis. Recent studies have showed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could reduce the risk of several types of cancer. However, epidemiological evidence of the association between NSAIDs intake , the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. To assess the preventive benefit of NSAIDs in HCC, we simultaneously searched the databases of PubMed, EmBase, Web of Science, , Scopus , screened eligible publications. A total of twelve articles (published from 2000 to 2017) from five countries were identified by retrieval. We observed a significantly lower risk of HCC incidence among users of NSAIDs than among those who did not use NSAIDs (pooled hazard ratio HR value =0.81, 95% confidence interval CI : 0.69-0.94). No evidence of publication bias was observed (Begg\\'s test, P=0.755 Egger\\'s test, P=0.564). However, when stratified according to the categories of NSAIDs, users of non-aspirin NSAIDs (HR =0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.94), but not aspirin (HR =0.77, 95% CI: 0.58-1.02), showed a statistically significant reduced HCC incidence. We also found that NSAIDs use significantly reduced the recurrent risk of HCC, with a HR value of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75-0.84), whereas there was no statistically significant association between NSAIDs use , HCC mortality, with a HR value 0.65 (95% CI: 0.40-1.06). Taken together, our meta-analysis demonstrates that NSAIDs significantly reduce the incident , recurrent risk of HCC.Sulforaphane, Epigallocatechin Gallate Restore Estrogen Receptor Expression by Modulating Epigenetic Events in the Breast Cancer Cell Line MDA-MB-231: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis. Epigenetics refers to modifications in gene activity, expression without alteration at the DNA sequence. Environment, diet could influence gene expression. Diet modifications may be meaningful in preventing, treating chronic diseases, cancer included. Dietary bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, or epigallocatechin gallate EGCG ) or isothiocyanate (e.g., sulforaphane SFN ), can regulate histone acetylation. The aim of this systematic review, meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of SFN, EGCG on breast cancer (BC) cells cultured in vitro. Due to the enormous variability observed in study protocols, the innumerable genes involved, only studies analyzing the number of apoptotic cells in the MDA-MB-231 cell line were evaluated. The effect size (ES) was computed as the ratio of means. We identified 7 studies, 4 regarding the effect of 10 ??M SFN on MDA-MB-231 cells (ES = 4.59, 95% confidence interval 4.05-5.20), 3 focusing on the impact of 20 ??M EGCG (ES = 2.84, 95% confidence interval 2.60-3.10). The findings suggest beneficial effects of dietary bioactive compounds such as SFN, EGCG, their effect on BC cells by restoring esr1 gene expression, modulating epigenetic changes, events,, interfering with tumor growth rate. Publication bias limits the generalizability of the conclusions. High-quality studies are needed.Intravasation of SW620 colon cancer cell spheroids through the blood endothelial barrier is inhibited by clinical drugs, flavonoids in vitro. Mechanisms how colorectal cancer (CRC) cells penetrate blood micro-vessel endothelia, metastasise is poorly understood. To study blood endothelial cell (BEC) barrier breaching by CRC emboli, an in vitro assay measuring BEC-free areas underneath SW620? cell spheroids, so called circular chemorepellent induced defects (CCIDs, appearing in consequence of endothelial retraction), was adapted, supported by Western blotting, EIA-, EROD-, luciferase reporter assays. Inhibition of ALOX12 or NF-kB in SW620? cells or BECs, respectively, caused attenuation of CCIDs. The FDA approved drugs vinpocetine inhibiting ALOX12-dependent 12(S HETE synthesis , ketotifen inhibiting NF-kB , carbamazepine, fenofibrate inhibiting 12(S HETE, NF-kB significantly attenuated CCID formation at low ??M concentrations. In the 5-FU-resistant SW620-R BEC model guanfacine, nifedipine, proadifen inhibited CCIDs stronger than in the na??ve SW620 BEC model. This indicated that in SW620-R cells formerly silent (yet unidentified) genes became expressed, targetable by these drugs in course of resistance acquisition. Fenofibrate,, the flavonoids hispidulin, apigenin, which are present in medicinal plants, spices, herbs, fruits, attenuated CCID formation in both, na??ve-, resistant models. As FDA-approved drugs, food-flavonoids inhibited established, acquired intravasative pathways, attenuated BEC barrier-breaching in vitro, this warrants testing of these compounds in CRC models in vivo.Effects of aspirin , non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the incidence of recurrent colorectal adenomas: a systematic review with meta-analysis , trial sequential analysis of r, omized clinical trials. Beneficial effects of aspirin , non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) against recurrent colorectal adenomas have been documented in systematic reviews however, the results have not been conclusive. Uncertainty remains about the appropriate dose of aspirin for adenoma prevention. The persistence of the protective effect of NSAIDs against recurrent adenomas after treatment cessation is yet to be established. Our objective was to update , systematically evaluate the evidence for aspirin , other NSAIDs on the incidence of recurrent colorectal adenomas taking into consideration the risks of r, om error , to appraise the quality of evidence using GRADE (The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development , Evaluation) approach. Retrieved trials were evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias instrument. Meta-analytic estimates were calculated with r, om-effects model , r, om errors were evaluated with trial sequential analysis (TSA). In patients with a previous history of colorectal cancer or adenomas, low-dose aspirin (80-160? mg day) compared to placebo taken for 2 to 4? years reduces the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas (relative risk (RR), 0.80 95% CI (confidence interval), 0.70-0.92 ). TSA indicated a firm evidence for this beneficial effect. The evidence indicated moderate GRADE quality. Low-dose aspirin also reduces the recurrence of advanced adenomas (RR, 0.66 95% CI, 0.44-0.99 ) however, TSA indicated lack of firm evidence for a beneficial effect. High-dose aspirin (300-325? mg day) did not statistically reduce the recurrent adenomas (RR, 0.90 95% CI, 0.68-1.18 ). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib 400? mg day) were associated with a significant decrease in the recurrence of both adenomas (RR, 0.66 95% CI, 0.59-0.72 ) , advanced adenomas (RR, 0.45 95% CI, 0.33-0.57 ). Our findings confirm the beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin on recurrence of any adenomas. COX-2 inhibitors seem to be more effective in preventing recurrence of adenomasSynthesis, biological evaluation, molecular docking studies of a new series of chalcones containing naphthalene moiety as anticancer agents. A series of chalcones containing naphthalene moiety 4a-4p have been synthesized, characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity. The majority of the screened compounds displayed potent anticancer activity against both HCT116, HepG2 human cancer cell lines. Among the series, compound 4h with a diethylamino group at the para position of the phenyl ring exhibited the most potent anticancer activity against HCT116, HepG2 cell lines with IC50 values of 1.20????????0.07, 1.02????????0.04?????M, respectively. The preliminary structure-activity relationship has been summarized. Tubulin polymerization experiments indicated that 4h effectively inhibited tubulin polymerization, flow cytometric assay revealed that 4h arrests HepG2 cells at the G2 M phase in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, molecular docking studies suggested that 4h binds to the colchicine binding site of tubulin. Inhibition of A2A Adenosine Receptor Signaling in Cancer Cells Proliferation by the Novel Antagonist TP455. Several evidences indicate that the ubiquitous nucleoside adenosine, acting through A1, A2A, A2B,, A3 receptor (AR) subtypes, plays crucial roles in tumor development. Adenosine has contrasting effects on cell proliferation depending on the engagement of different receptor subtypes in various tumors. The involvement of A2AARs in human A375 melanoma, as well as in human A549 lung, rat MRMT1 breast carcinoma proliferation has been evaluated in view of the availability of a novel A2AAR antagonist, with high affinity, selectivity, named as 2-(2-furanyl N5-(2-methoxybenzyl) 1,3 thiazolo 5,4-d pyrimidine-5,7-diammine (TP455). Specifically, the signaling pathways triggered in the cancer cells of different origin, the antagonist effect of TP455 were investigated. The A2AAR protein expression was evaluated through receptor binding assays. Furthermore, the effect of A2AAR activation on cell proliferation at 24, 48, 72 hours was studied. The selective A2AAR agonist 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5\\'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine hydrochloride (CGS21680), concentration-dependently induced cell proliferation in A375, A549,, MRMT1 cancer cells, the effect was potently antagonized by the A2AAR antagonist TP455, as well as by the reference A2AAR blocker 4-(2- 7-amino-2-(2-furyl) 1,2,4 triazolo 2,3-a 1,3,5 triazin-5-ylamino ethyl)phenol (ZM241385). As for the signaling pathway recruited in this response we demonstrated that, by using the specific inhibitors of signal transduction pathways, the effect of A2AAR stimulation was induced through phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta). In addition, we evaluated, through the AlphaScreen SureFire phospho(p) protein assay, the kinases enrolled by A2AAR to stimulate cell proliferation, we found the involvement of protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular regulated kinases (ERK1 2),, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Indeed, we demonstrated that the CGS21680 stimulatory effect on kinases was strongly reduced in the presence of the new potent compound TP455, as well as by ZM241385, confirming the role of the A2AAR. In conclusion, the A2AAR activation stimulates proliferation of A375, A549,, MRMT1 cancer cells, importantly TP455 reveals its capability to counteract this effect, suggesting selective A2AAR antagonists as potential new therapeutics.Regulation of Polyamine Metabolism by Curcumin for Cancer Prevention, Therapy. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the natural polyphenol responsible for the characteristic yellow pigment of the spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), is traditionally known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,, anticarcinogenic properties. Capable of affecting the initiation, promotion,, progression of carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms, curcumin has potential utility for both chemoprevention, chemotherapy. In human cancer cell lines, curcumin has been shown to decrease ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis that is frequently upregulated in cancer, other rapidly proliferating tissues. Numerous studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with curcumin can abrogate carcinogen-induced ODC activity, tumor development in rodent tumorigenesis models targeting various organs.

Engineering functional nanomaterials with high therapeutic efficacy, minimum side effects has increasingly become a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Herein, a ros (ROS) enhanced combination chemotherapy platform is designed via a biocompatible metal-polyphenol networks self-assembly process by encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX), platinum prodrugs in nanoparticles. Both DOX, platinum drugs can activate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases, generating superoxide radicals (O2??√å?- ). The superoxide dismutase-like activity of polyphenols can catalyze H2 O2 generation from O2??√å?- . Finally, the highly toxic HO??√å? free radicals are generated by a Fenton reaction. The ROS HO??√å? can synergize the chemotherapy by a cascade of bioreactions. Positron emission tomography imaging of 89 Zr-labeled as-prepared DOX@Pt prodrug Fe3 nanoparticles (DPPF NPs) shows prolonged blood circulation, high tumor accumulation. Furthermore, the DPPF NPs can effectively inhibit tumor growth, reduce the side effects of anticancer drugs. This study establishes a novel ROS promoted synergistic nanomedicine platform for cancer therapy. Vitexin induces G2 M???phase arrest, apoptosis via Akt mTOR signaling pathway in human glioblastoma cells. Glioblastoma is a common primary brain tumor with aggressive malignancy, which results in poor outcomes, short survival time, high mortality. Vitexin, an active ingredient from natural products, has been reported to inhibit cell growth, induce cell apoptosis in various cancer cell lines including hepatocellular carcinoma, oral, esophageal cancer. To the best of the authors knowledge, the present study was the first to investigate anticancer effects of vitexin on human glioblastoma cells, potential underlying mechanisms. The present study demonstrated that vitexin inhibited cell viability in a dose???, time???dependent manner. In the present study, vitexin induced G2 M cell cycle arrest, as demonstrated by flow cytometry. Induction of cell apoptosis following vitexin treatment, was further indicated by observation of morphological alterations, flow cytometry analysis, detection of cleaved???poly (ADP???ribose) polymerase. The present study also demonstrated that vitexin inhibited RAC???alpha serine threonine???protein kinase (Akt) mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) signaling in human glioblastoma cells. Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrated that vitexin induced G2 M cell cycle arrest, apoptosis by inhibiting Akt mTOR signaling in human glioblastoma cells. Vitexin may in the future be used as a therapeutic agent for treatment of malignant glioblastomaNanostructured Peptidotoxins as Natural Pro-Oxidants Induced Cancer Cell Death via Amplification of Oxidative Stress. Melittin (Mel), one of the host defense peptides derived from the venom of honeybees, demonstrates substantial anticancer properties, which is attributed to augmenting ros (ROS) generation. However, little has been reported on its pro-oxidation capacity in cancer oxidation therapy. In this study, an ROS amplifying nanodevice was fabricated through direct complexation of two natural pro-oxidants, Mel, condensed epigallocatechin gallate (pEGCG). The obtained nanocomplex (NC) was further covered with phenylboronic acid derivatized hyaluronic acid (pHA) through the ROS-responsive boronate ester coordination bond to produce pHA-NC. Upon undergoing receptor-mediated endocytosis into cancer cells, the inner cores of pHA-NC will be partially uncovered once pHA corona is degraded by hyaluronidase, will then escape from the lysosome by virtue of cytolytic Mel. The elevated ROS level in the tumor cytoplasm can disrupt the boronate ester bond to facilitate drug release. Both Mel, pEGCG could synergistically amplify oxidative stress, prolong ROS retention in cancer cells, leading to enhanced anticancer efficacy. This ROS cascade amplifier based on selective coordination bond, inherent pro-oxidation properties of natural ingredients could detect, elevate intracellular ROS signals, potentiating to move the tumor away from its homeostasis, make the tumor vulnerable. Compared to previously reported chemosynthetic pro-oxidants, the ROS self-sufficient system, fully composed of natural medicine, from this study provides a new insight in developing cancer oxidation therapy.Effects of polyphenols on doxorubicin-induced oral keratinocyte cytotoxicity, anticancer potency against oral cancer cells. Normal human oral keratinocytes are highly sensitive to anticancer drugs including doxorubicin. Resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate,, tannic acid are polyphenolic compounds that were reported to have cardioprotective effect when combined with doxorubicin. However, it is unknown whether these polyphenols could protect normal human oral keratinocytes against doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity without weakening its cytotoxic potential against oral cancer cells. Here, we examined the effects of the 3 polyphenolic compounds on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in normal human oral keratinocytes, also investigated their effects on doxorubicin potency in HSC-2 human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Cell viability was evaluated, followed by the analysis of apoptosis, necrosis. The changes in intracellular ros at the early stage after treatment were also examined. The results revealed that resveratrol in combination with doxorubicin additively augmented doxorubicin cytotoxicity in both types of cells. However, epigallocatechin gallate, tannic acid at a certain concentration mitigated the doxorubicin-induced keratinocyte toxicity mainly due to reduced doxorubicin-induced necrosis in normal human oral keratinocytes without weaken doxorubicin anticancer efficacy. The exact mechanism is still unknown but intracellular ros might be not the sole factor. This study for the first time reported the effects of resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate,, tannic acid on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in normal oral keratinocytes, oral cancer cells. The combined use of epigallocatechin gallate or tannic acid with doxorubicin at a certain concentration could mitigate doxorubicin-induced keratinocyte cytotoxicity without weakening doxorubicin anticancer efficacy.Nutritional Compositions, Antiproliferative Activities of Different Solvent Fractions from Ethanol Extract of Cyphomandra betacea (Tamarillo) Fruit. This study aims to examine various solvent extracts of Cyphomandra betacea (tamarillo) also known as the tree tomato, for their bioactive constituents, antioxidant activity. The study also aims to examine its effect on cancer cell death using two types of cancer cell lines (liver, breast cancer cell). The first part of the study evaluates the nutritional composition of tamarillo. Then, phytochemical profiling using GC-MS analysis in ethanolic tamarillo extract was conducted. Different fractions of n-butanol, ethyl acetate, aqueous fractions were obtained from the ethanolic extract of tamarillo. Then, the fractions were subjected to the quantification of total phenol (TPC), flavonoid contents (TFC), free radical scavenging activity (SA), also antioxidant activity (AOX) assayed by beta-carotene bleaching (BCB) assay. Finally, the capability of the ethanolic extract of tamarillo, different fractions were evaluated for their anticancer properties. Findings from this study revealed that the nutritional composition (ash, protein, carbohydrate, total dietary fiber),, mineral levels (calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron) of tamarillo were moderate. The crude ethanol extract of tamarillo contained the highest phenolic, total flavonoid content. FT-IR analysis revealed the presence of alkanes, carboxylic acid, phenol, alkanes, carboxylic acids, aromatics, nitro compounds. Twelve bioactive constituents in tamarillo have been identified through GC-MS analysis. Cytotoxic activity suggests the potential of ethanolic extracts of tamarillo having a chemopreventive effect on breast, liver cancer cells. This study reveals that tamarillo has substantial antioxidant activity as well as anticancer properties.The apple polyphenol phloretin inhibits breast cancer cell migration, proliferation via inhibition of signals by type 2 glucose transporter. Human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive, poorly understood subclass of breast cancer. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are required for glucose uptake in malignant cancer cells, are ideal targets for cancer therapy. To determine whether the inhibition of GLUTs could be used in TNBC cell therapy, the apple polyphenol phloretin (Ph) was used as a specific antagonist of GLUT2 protein function in human TNBC cells. Interestingly, we found that Ph (10-150? ??M, for 24? h) inhibited cell growth, arrested the cell cycle in MDA-MB-231? cells in a p53 mutant-dependent manner, which was confirmed by pre-treatment of the cells with a p53-specific dominant-negative expression vector. We also found that Ph treatment (10-150? ??M, for 24? h) significantly decreased the migratory activity of the MDA-MB-231? cells through the inhibition of paxillin FAK, Src,, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-sMA), through the activation of E-cadherin. Furthermore, the anti-tumorigenic effect of Ph (10, 50? mg kg or DMSO twice a week for six weeks) was demonstrated in? vivo using BALB c nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts. A decrease in N-cadherin, vimentin, an increase in p53, p21, E-cadherin were detected in the tumor tissues. In conclusion, inhibition of GLUT2 by the apple polyphenol Ph could potentially suppress TNBC tumor cell growth, metastasis. Biophysical evidence for differential gallated green tea catechins binding to membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase, its interactors. Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a transmembrane MMP which triggers intracellular signaling, regulates extracellular matrix proteolysis, two functions that are critical for tumor-associated angiogenesis, inflammation. While green tea catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), are considered very effective in preventing MT1-MMP-mediated functions, lack of structure-function studies, evidence regarding their direct interaction with MT1-MMP-mediated biological activities remain. Here, we assessed the impact in both cellular, biophysical assays of four ungallated catechins along with their gallated counterparts on MT1-MMP-mediated functions, molecular binding partners. Concanavalin-A (ConA) was used to trigger MT1-MMP-mediated proMMP-2 activation, expression of MT1-MMP, of endoplasmic reticulum stress biomarker GRP78 in U87 glioblastoma cells. We found that ConA-mediated MT1-MMP induction was inhibited by EGCG, catechin gallate (CG), that GRP78 induction was inhibited by EGCG, CG,, gallocatechin gallate (GCG), whereas proMMP-2 activation was inhibited by EGCG, GCG. Surface plasmon resonance was used to assess direct interaction between catechins, MT1-MMP interactors. We found that gallated catechins interacted better than their ungallated analogs with MT1-MMP as well as with MT1-MMP binding partners MMP-2, TIMP-2, MTCBP-1, LRP1-clusterIV. Overall, current structure-function evidence supports a role for the galloyl moiety in both direct, indirect interactions of green tea catechins with MT1-MMP-mediated oncogenic processes.Identification of UGTs, BCRP as potential pharmacokinetic determinants of the natural flavonoid alpinetin. Alpinetin is a natural flavonoid showing a variety of pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, hypolipidemic activities. Here, we aim to determine the roles of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in disposition of alpinetin. Glucuronidation potential of alpinetin was evaluated using pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM), pooled human intestine microsomes (pHIM), expressed UGT enzymes supplemented with the cofactor UDPGA. Activity correlation analyses with a bank of individual HLMs were performed to identify the main contributing UGT isozymes in hepatic glucuronidation of alpinetin. The effect of BCRP on alpinetin disposition was assessed using HeLa cells overexpressing UGT1A1 (HeLa1A1) cells. Alpinetin underwent extensive glucuronidation in pHLM, pHIM, generating one glucuronide metabolite. Of 12 test UGT enzymes, UGT1A3 was the most active one toward alpinetin with an intrinsic clearance (CLint???=???Vmax Km) value of 66.5?????l min nmol, followed by UGT1A1 (CLint???=???48.6?????l min nmol), UGT1A9 (CLint???=???21.0?????l min nmol), UGT2B15 (CLint???=???16.7?????l min nmol), UGT1A10 (CLint???=???1.60?????l min nmol). Glucuronidation of alpinetin was significantly correlated with glucuronidation of estradiol (an activity marker of UGT1A1), chenodeoxycholic acid (an activity marker of UGT1A3), propofol (an activity marker of UGT1A9), 5-hydroxyrofecoxib (an activity marker of UGT2B15), confirming the important roles of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, UGT2B15 in alpinetin glucuronidation. Inhibition of BCRP by its specific inhibitor Ko143 significantly reduced excretion of alpinetin glucuronide, leading to a significant decrease in cellular glucuronidation of alpinetin. Our data suggest UGTs, BCRP as two important determinants of alpinetin pharmacokinetics.Amentoflavone is a potent broad-spectrum inhibitor of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Amentoflavone (AMF), an abundant natural biflavonoid found in many medicinal plants, displays various beneficial effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-cancer. Despite the extensive studies on pharmacological activities, the toxicity or undesirable effects of AMF are rarely reported. In this study, the inhibitory effects of AMF on human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) were carefully investigated. AMF displayed strong inhibition towards most of human UGTs including UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, 2B4, 2B17, with the IC50 values ranging from 0.12?????M to 16.81?????M. Inhibition constants (Ki) of AMF against various human UGTs varied from. Further investigation demonstrated that AMF was a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A1 mediated 4-MU-O-glucuronidation. In addition, AMF was a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A4 mediated TFP-N-glucuronidation in both UGT1A4, human liver microsomes, while functioned as a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A9 mediated propofol or 4-MU-O-glucuronidation. These findings demonstrated that AMF was a strong, broad-spectrum natural inhibitor of most human UGT. Additionally, this study provided novel insights into the underlying mechanism of AMF-associated toxicity from the perspective of UGT inhibition. Investigation of the effects of curcumin, vitamin E, their combination in cisplatin-induced testicular apoptosis using immunohistochemical technique. Cisplatin is an effective antineoplastic agent used in cancer therapy. However, the use of cisplatin is restricted due to its toxic side effects. Alleviation of its side effects which restricts cisplatin use is highly important. We aimed to investigate the effects of curcumin, vitamin E, their combination in cisplatin induced testicular apoptosis. Thirty-five Wistar albino male adult rats, weighing 300-350 g were divided randomly into five groups including seven rats in each as control, cisplatin, curcumin, vitamin E,, curcumin vitamin E. On the posttest 5th day, rats were sacrificed,, their testes were removed. 4-5 ??m sections from formalin fixed paraffin embedded testis tissues were stained both hematoxylin-eosin to analyze histologically, immunohistochemically to determine the expression of the apoptotic pathway proteins (Bax, Cas-3, Bcl-2). Increased histological damage with cisplatin administration was reduced in treatment, especially in combination therapy. Cas-3, Bax protein immunostaining intensities H-scores were significantly increased but Bcl-2 was slightly decreased in the cisplatin group compared to the control. In all treatment groups Bax, Cas-3 decreased compared to cisplatin group however Bcl-2 decreased in the curcumin, vitamin E groups. Bax Bcl-2 was the highest in the cisplatin,, decreased in all treatment groups in favor of control. Cas-3 expression increased by cisplatin administration suggests that cisplatin causes apoptosis of germ cells. According to the present findings, cisplatin mainly caused testicular apoptosis through the Cas-3, Bax apoptotic protein pathways. Cisplatin-induced testicular apoptosis can be prevented by administration of curcumin, vitamin E,, combination therapy.Natural polyphenols as sirtuin 6 modulators. Flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary metabolites synthesized by plants, fungus with various pharmacological effects. Due to their plethora of biological activities, they have been studied extensively in drug development. They have been shown to modulate the activity of a NAD -dependent histone deacetylase, SIRT6. Because SIRT6 has been implicated in longevity, metabolism, DNA-repair,, inflammatory response reduction, it is an interesting target in inflammatory, metabolic diseases as well as in cancer. Here we show, that flavonoids can alter SIRT6 activity in a structure dependent manner. Catechin derivatives with galloyl moiety displayed significant inhibition potency against SIRT6 at 10?????M concentration. The most potent SIRT6 activator, cyanidin, belonged to anthocyanidins,, produced a 55-fold increase in SIRT6 activity compared to the 3-10 fold increase for the others. Cyanidin also significantly increased SIRT6 expression in Caco-2 cells. Results from the docking studies indicated possible binding sites for the inhibitors, activators. Inhibitors likely bind in a manner that could disturb NAD binding. The putative activator binding site was found next to a loop near the acetylated peptide substrate binding site. In some cases, the activators changed the conformation of this loop suggesting that it may play a role in SIRT6 activation.Tannic Acid Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an intriguing target with significant clinical importance in chemotherapy. Interference with ER functions can lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins, as detected by transmembrane sensors that instigate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Therefore, controlling induced UPR via ER stress with natural compounds could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of prostate cancer. Tannic acid (a naturally occurring polyphenol) was used to examine the ER stress mediated UPR pathway in prostate cancer cells. Tannic acid treatment inhibited the growth, clonogenic, invasive,, migratory potential of prostate cancer cells. Tannic acid demonstrated activation of ER stress response (Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)), altered its regulatory proteins (ATF4, Bip,, PDI) expression. Tannic acid treatment affirmed upregulation of apoptosis-associated markers (Bak, Bim, cleaved caspase 3,, cleaved PARP), while downregulation of pro-survival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL). Tannic acid exhibited elevated G??? population, due to increase in p18INK4C, p21WAF1 CIP1 expression, while cyclin D1 expression was inhibited. Reduction of MMP2, MMP9,, reinstated E-cadherin signifies the anti-metastatic potential of this compound. Altogether, these results demonstrate that tannic acid can promote apoptosis via the ER stress mediated UPR pathway, indicating a potential candidate for cancer treatment.Food polyphenols targeting peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase Pin1. We searched for inhibitors against prolyl isomerase Pin1 in order to develop functional foods to prevent, cure various Pin1 related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimers\\'s disease,, so on. We created a polyphenol library consisting of ingredients in healthy foods, beverages, since polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in green tea, 974B in brown algae had been identified as its Pin1 inhibitors. Several polyphenols such as EGCG derivatives, caffeic acid derivatives, tannic acid inhibited Pin1 activity. These results provide a first step in development of the functional foods, beverage targeting Pin1, its related diseases. Synthesis, biological evaluation of alpha-bromoacryloylamido indolyl pyridinyl propenones as potent apoptotic inducers in human leukaemia cells. The combination of two pharmacophores into a single molecule represents one of the methods that can be adopted for the synthesis of new anticancer molecules. To investigate the influence of the position of the pyridine nitrogen on biological activity, two different series of alpha-bromoacryloylamido indolyl pyridinyl propenones 3a-h, 4a-d were designed, synthesized by a pharmacophore hybridization approach, evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against a panel of six human cancer cell lines. These hybrid molecules were prepared to combine the alpha-bromoacryloyl moiety with two series of indole-inspired chalcone analogues, possessing an indole derivative, a 3- or 4-pyridine ring, respectively, linked on either side of 2-propen-1-one system. The structure-activity relationship was also investigated by the insertion of alkyl or benzyl moieties at the N-1 position of the indole nucleus. We found that most of the newly synthesized displayed high antiproliferative activity against U-937, MOLT-3, K-562,, NALM-6 leukaemia cell lines, with one-digit to double-digit nanomolar IC50 values. The antiproliferative activities of 3-pyridinyl derivatives 3f-h revealed that N-benzyl indole analogues generally exhibited lower activity compared to N-H or N-alkyl derivatives 3a-b, 3c-e, respectively. Moreover, cellular mechanism studies elucidated that compound 4a induced apoptosis along with a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, activated caspase-3 in a concentration-dependent manner.ANTIOXIDANT AND CANCER CHEMOPREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES OF CISTUS AND POMEGRANATE POLYPHENOLS. Polyphenol rich extracts obtained from cistus herb (Cistus incanus L.), pomegranate peel (Punica granatum L.) exhibited significant antioxidant activity in V79 cell culture (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts) -cistus extract reduced intracellular content of ros (ROS) by 30-40%, pomegranate extract by 29-36%. In human breast (MCF-7), colon (LOVO) cancer cell lines cistus, pomegranate extracts decreased cancer cell growth both in drug-sensitive cells by 15-30%, in drug resistant (doxorubicin-resistant DX) sublines by 5-20%. The extracts induced apoptosis in the tested cancer cell lines. Significantly higher proapoptotic impact of the extracts was observed in drug-sensitive than in drug-resistant sublines. The results suggest potential usefulness of the tested polyphenol rich extracts in people exposed to oxidative stress. Their potential use as adjuvant therapy of human cancers needs further studies.A new generation of ferrociphenols leads to a great diversity of reactive metabolites,, exhibits remarkable antiproliferative properties. Organometallic compounds bearing the redox motif ferrocenyl-ene-phenol have very promising antiproliferative properties which have been further improved by incorporating pertinent substituents able to engender new mechanisms. Here we show that novel ferrociphenols bearing a hydroxypropyl chain exhibit strong antiproliferative effects, in most cases much better than those of cisplatin, tamoxifen, or of previously described ferrociphenols devoid of this terminal OH. This is illustrated, in the case of one of these compounds, by its IC50 values of 110 nM for MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells, of 300 nM for cisplatin-resistant A2780cisR human ovarian cancer cells,, by its GI50 values lower than 100 nM towards a series of melanoma, renal cancer cell lines of the NCI-60 panel. Interestingly, oxidative metabolism of these hydroxypropyl-ferrociphenols yields two kinds of quinone methides (QMs) that readily react with various nucleophiles, such as glutathione, to give 1,6-, 1,8-adducts. Protonation of these quinone methides generates numerous reactive metabolites leading eventually to many rearrangement, cleavage products. This unprecedented, fully characterized metabolic profile involving a wide range of electrophilic metabolites that should react with cell macromolecules may be linked to the remarkable profile of antiproliferative activities of this new series. Indeed, the great diversity of unexpected reactive metabolites found upon oxidation will allow them to adapt to various situations present in the cancer cell. These data initiate a novel strategy for the rational design of anticancer molecules, thus opening the way to new organometallic potent anticancer drug candidates for the treatment of chemoresistant cancers.Propofol Inhibits HeLa Cells by Impairing Autophagic Flux via AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) Activation, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Regulated by Calcium.   Propofol has antitumor effects against various cancers. However, the mechanism of action of propofol in HeLa human cervical cancer cells has not been elucidated.   We treated HeLa human cervical cancer cells with different concentrations of propofol. Cell viability was evaluated with Cell Counting Kit-8, apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate, propidium iodide staining, flow cytometry. Autophagosome formation was evaluated based on microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC)3 conversion, light chain 3 puncta formation. Autophagosome clearance was assessed according to p62 protein level, autolysosome generation.   We found that propofol decreased cell viability, increased autophagosome generation in HeLa cells. Autophagosome formation was evaluated based on LC3 conversion, LC3 puncta formation. Autophagosome clearance was assessed according to p62 protein level. The AMPK mTOR signaling pathway was found to be activated in propofol-induced autophagosome accumulation. Fluorescence analysis using LysoTracker dye revealed that propofol blocked autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Administration of rapamycin increased autophagosome clearance in propofol-treated HeLa cells. Additionally, propofol induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, disrupted intracellular Ca2 balance, thereby enhancing autophagosome accumulation. Suppressing ER stress by treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) enhanced these effects, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of propofol is related to induction of ER stress.  S This study is the first to provide evidence that propofol-mediated autophagy regulation is an underlying part of the mechanism by which propofol regulates HeLa cells progression.The critical role of epigallocatechin gallate in regulating mitochondrial metabolism. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of polyphenols isolated from green tea, exhibits biology-benefiting effects with minimum severe adverse. EGCG is known to be a mitochondrion-targeting medicinal agent, regulating mitochondrial metabolism, including mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial bioenergetics,, mitochondria-mediated cell cycle, apoptosis. EGCG might exhibit either antioxidative activity to prevent against oxidative stress or pro-oxidative activity to counteract cancer cells, which depends on the cellular stress situations, cell types, the concentration of EGCG. Recent research has gained positive, promising data. This review will discuss the interaction between EGCG, mitochondrion.Perspectives on the recent developments with green tea polyphenols in drug discovery. Increasing evidence has expanded the role of green tea from a traditional beverage to a source of pharmacologically active molecules with diverse health benefits. However, conclusive clinical results are needed to better elucidate the cancer-preventive, therapeutic effects of green tea polyphenols (GTPs). Areas covered: The authors describe GTPs\\' chemical compositions, metabolic biotransformations,, their recent developments in drug discovery, focusing on their cancer chemopreventive, therapeutic effects. They then review the recent development of GTP-loaded nanoparticles, GTP prodrugs. Expert opinion: GTPs possess potent anticarcinogenic activities through interfering with the initiation, development, progression phases of cancer. There are several challenges (e.g. poor bioavailability) in developing GTPs as therapeutic agents. Use of nanoparticle-based delivery systems has provided unique advantages over purified GTPs. However, there is still a need to determine the actual magnitude, pharmacological mechanisms of GTPs encapsulated in nanoparticles, in order to address newly emerging safety issues associated with the potential \\'local overdose\\' effect. The use of Proepigallocatechin-3-gallate (Pro-EGCG) as a prodrug appears to offer improved in vitro stability as well as better in vivo bioavailability, efficacies in a number of animal studies, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for further study, development.Selection of G1-PABA as a GPER1 ligand compared to phenol red via a ligand-based virtual screening coupled to molecular dynamics simulations, its anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer cells. Recent reports have demonstrated the role of the G protein-coupled esr1 (GPER1) on the growth, proliferation of breast cancer cells. The coupling of GPER1 to estrogen, tamoxifen or fulvestrant triggers cellular signaling pathways (PI3K, ERK) related to cell proliferation. In an effort to develop new therapeutic strategies against breast cancer, we performed an in silico study to explore the binding pose of a set of designed G15, G1 analogue compounds, including phenol red. First, we included a carboxyl group instead of the acetyl group from G1 to form amides with several moieties to increase the affinity for GPER1. Then, all the target compounds were submitted to an in silico ADMET study. Then, the ligands were coupled to GPER1 using ligand-based virtual screening to finally achieve molecular dynamics simulations of the best molecule on GPER1, as well as of phenol red, to explore its recognition properties. According to the in silico ADMET, docking studies, the best molecule was named G1-PABA ((3aS,4R,9bR 4-(6-bromobenzo d 1,3 dioxol-5-yl 3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta c quinoline-8-carboxylic acid). It was synthesized, assayed in vitro in breast cancer (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), normal (MCF-10A) cell lines. Experimental assays showed that the target compound was able to decrease cell proliferation, showing IC50 values of 15.93 ???M, 52.92 ???M, 32.45 ???M in the MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A cell lines, respectively, after 72 h of treatment. Interestingly, the target compound showed better IC50 values without phenol red, suggesting that phenol red could interfere with the G1-PABA action at GPER, which is present in MCF-7 cells according to PCR studies, explains the cell proliferation effects. In conclusion, a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation occurred with G1-PABA in the assayed cell lines, could be due to its action on GPER1.Characterization of phenolic extracts from Brava extra virgin olive oils, their cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phenolic profile of the \\'Brava\\' extra virgin olive oil, assess its potential as a natural adjuvant in combination with chemotherapy treatment. The total phenol content of the phenolic extracts was 764???mg gallic acid equivalents kg, the total antioxidant capacity was 2309, 1881, 2088?????M trolox equivalents kg determined by Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical method, Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power, Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity assay, respectively. Secoiridoids comprised 83% of the total phenolic compounds. The main secoiridoid from oleuropein was the main isomer of oleuropein aglycone (74???mg kg). The main secoiridoid from ligstroside was the main isomer of ligstroside aglycone (214???mg kg). These phenolic extracts showed a significant decrease in cell viability on MCF-7 breast cancer cells in a dose, time dependent manner. 48 h-treatments with different concentrations of the extracts induced intracellular ROS generation, cell death.Curcumin Induces a Fatal Energetic Impairment in Tumor Cells in Vitro, in Vivo by Inhibiting ATP-synthase Activity. Curcumin has been reported to inhibit inflammation, tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis by decreasing cell growth, by inducing apoptosis mainly through the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkB), a master regulator of inflammation. Recent reports also indicate potential metabolic effects of the polyphenol, therefore we analyzed whether, how it affects the energy metabolism of tumor cells. We show that curcumin (10??M) inhibits the activity of ATP-synthase in isolated mitochondrial membranes leading to a dramatic drop of ATP, a reduction of oxygen consumption in in vitro, in vivo tumor models. The effects of curcumin on ATP-synthase are independent of the inhibition of NFkB since the IkB Kinase inhibitor, SC-514, does not affect ATP-synthase. The activities of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase are only slightly affected in a cell type specific manner. The energy impairment translates into decreased tumor cell viability. Moreover, curcumin induced apoptosis by promoting the generation of ros (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid oxidation,, autophagy at least in part due to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). According to the in vitro anti-tumor effect, curcumin (30mg kg body weight) significantly delayed in vivo cancer growth likely due to an energy impairment but also through the reduction of tumor angiogenesis. These results establish the ATP-synthase, a central enzyme of the cellular energy metabolism, as a target of the anti-tumoral polyphenol leading to inhibition of cancer cell growth, a general reprogramming of tumor metabolism.Identification of Estrogen Receptor alpha Antagonists from Natural Products via In Vitro, In Silico Approaches. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a successful target for ER-positive breast cancer, also reported to be relevant in many other diseases. Selective esr1 modulators (SERMs) make a good therapeutic effect in clinic. Because of the drug resistance, side effects of current SERMs, the discovery of new SERMs is given more, more attention. Virtual screening is a validated method to high effectively to identify novel bioactive small molecules. Ligand-based machine learning methods, structure-based molecular docking were first performed for identification of ERalpha antagonist from in-house natural product library. Naive Bayesian, recursive partitioning models with two kinds of descriptors were built, validated based on training set, test set,, external test set, then were utilized for distinction of active, inactive compounds. Totally, 162 compounds were predicted as ER antagonists, were further evaluated by molecular docking. According to docking score, we selected 8 representative compounds for both ERalpha competitor assay, luciferase reporter gene assay. Genistein, daidzein, phloretin, ellagic acid, ursolic acid, (- epigallocatechin-3-gallate, kaempferol,, naringenin exhibited different levels for antagonistic activity against ERalpha. These studies validated the feasibility of machine learning methods for predicting bioactivities of ligands, provided better insight into the natural products acting as esr1 modulator, which are important lead compounds for future new drug design.An Overview of Natural Plant Products in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Liver cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer, the second leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Among the liver cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported to be responsible for 85-90% of primary liver cancer, it is the second most common cause of cancer mortality with 700,000 deaths documented annually. The major risk factors of HCC include chronic infections with the hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) virus, chronic liver diseases, alcoholism as well as dietary carcinogens, such as aflatoxins. Highest incidence rates are estimated to occur in Asia, Africa. The effectiveness of current man-made agents in treating chronic liver disease is not satisfactory, they have uninvited side effects. Herbal medicines are extensively used all over the world however there is still a vast gap in accepting them by the scientific community. Plants are rich in secondary metabolites, phytochemicals obtained from both, dietary, non-dietary sources. Natural plant products are potent therapeutic as well as chemo preventive agents for numerous chronic diseases like cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative, neoplastic diseases. Dietary phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin, silibinin, N-trans-feruloyloctopamine, lycopene, emodin, caffeine, urolithin A, Phloretin have been found to be useful for the treatment of HCC, other diseases, report estimate that 60% of the anticancer medication in current use has been obtained from natural sources. Thus, derivatives from plants have played an essential role in cancer prevention due to their pleiotropic abilities to scavenge free radicals, inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis. In Vitro Antioxidant Activities of Phenols, Oleanolic Acid from Mango Peel, Their Cytotoxic Effect on A549 Cell Line. Mango peel, the main by-product of juice processing, possesses appreciable quantities of bioactive phenolic compounds, is worthy of further utilization. The present work reports for the first time the HPLC analysis, in vitro antioxidant evaluation of mango peel phenols (MPPs), their cytotoxic effect on the A549 lung cancer cell line. These results indicated that mango peel has the total phenolic content of 723.2 ?? 0.93 mgmiddotkgminus1 dry mango peel (DMP), which consisted mainly of vanillic aldehyde, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, procyanidin B???, oleanolic acid. Antioxidant assays showed that MPPs had strong antioxidant activities, with 92 ?? 4.2% of DPPH radical scavenging rate, 79 ?? 2.5% of ABTS radical inhibition rate, 4.7 ?? 0.5 muM Trolox equivalents per kgminus1 DMP of ferric reducing power. Gallic acid possess a stronger antioxidant capacity than other phenols. In vitro cytotoxic tests suggested that mango peel extract (MPE) had an IC50 value of 15 mgmiddotmLminus1, MPPs had a stronger inhibitory effect on the A549 cell line. Oleanolic acid exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity, with an IC50 value of 4.7 muM, which was similar with that of the positive control 5-fluorouracil.4\\'-Methoxyresveratrol Alleviated AGE-Induced Inflammation via RAGE-Mediated NF-kB, NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) could interact with the receptor for AGE (RAGE) as a sterile danger signal to induce inflammation. 4prime-methoxyresveratrol (4primeMR), a polyphenol derived from Dipterocarpaceae, has not been studied for its anti-inflammation effects. In the present study, we sought to explore the protective role of 4primeMR in AGEs-induced inflammatory model using RAW264.7 macrophages. 4primeMR significantly inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, such as interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tnf (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), as well as two typical pro-inflammatory enzymes, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). Besides, 4primeMR significantly decreased oxidative stress, demonstrated by levels of ROS production, protein carbonyl, advanced oxidation protein product via down-regulation of NADPH oxidase. Further analysis showed that 4primeMR attenuated the RAGE overexpression induced by MGO-BSA. It also blocked the downstream signal of AGE-RAGE, particularly, MAPKs including p38, JNK,, subsequently reduced NF-kappaB activation. Additionally, 4primeMR significantly abated the activation of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, reduced the secretion of mature IL-1beta. Taken together, our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of 4primeMR is mainly through suppressing RAGE-mediated MAPK NF-kappaB signaling pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 4primeMR could be a novel therapeutic agent for inflammation-related diseases.Mitochondrial Delivery of Phenol Substructure Triggers Mitochondrial Depolarization, Apoptosis of Cancer Cells. Antitumor chemotherapy remains one of the most important challenge of the medicinal chemistry. Emerging research in chemotherapy is focused on exploiting the biochemical differences between cancer cell, normal cell metabolism in order to reduce the side effects, increase antitumor therapy efficacy. The higher mitochondrial transmembrane potential of cancer cells compared to not-transformed cells favors the intra-mitochondrial accumulation of cationic drugs in the former. This feature could be exploited to allow selective delivery of antineoplastic drugs to the cancer cells. In this work we designed, synthetized phenol derivatives joined to the triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation, a well-known vector for mitochondrial targeting. Two designed phenol TPP-derivatives 1, 2 show remarkable cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines, but were less toxic against normal cells. The differential cytotoxicity relied on the higher mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative-phosphorylation metabolism of the former. By reducing mitochondrial mass, energetic metabolism,, increasing at the same time the levels of intra-mitochondrial ros, phenol TPP-derivatives 1, 2 induced mitochondria depolarization, triggered a caspase 9 3-mediated apoptosis, limited to cancer cells. This work provides the rationale to further develop phenol TPP-derivatives targeting mitochondria as new, selective anticancer tools.Green tea polyphenol EGCG suppresses Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by promoting GSK-3beta- and PP2A-independent beta-catenin phosphorylation/degradation. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, has been reported to inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which is aberrantly up-regulated in colorectal cancers, but its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we used a sensitive cell-based system to demonstrate that EGCG suppresses beta-catenin response transcription (CRT), activated by Wnt3a-conditioned medium (Wnt3a-CM), by promoting the degradation of intracellular beta-catenin. EGCG induced beta-catenin N-terminal phosphorylation at the Ser33/37 residues and subsequently promoted its degradation however, this effect was not observed for oncogenic forms of beta-catenin. Pharmacological inhibition or depletion of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) did not abrogate the EGCG-mediated beta-catenin degradation. EGCG did not affect the activity and expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Consistently, the phosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin was found in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutated colon cancer cells after EGCG treatment. EGCG repressed the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc, which are beta-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent genes, and inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Our findings suggest that EGCG exerts its cancer-preventive or anticancer activity against colon cancer cells by promoting the phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of beta-catenin through a mechanism independent of the GSK-3beta and PP2A.The protective role of carotenoids and polyphenols in patients with head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer is a critical global health problem and approximately 650,000 patients per year are diagnosed with this type of cancer. In addition, head and neck cancer exhibits a high recurrence rate, readily causing second primary cancers in other locations, often yielding a poor prognosis. Current medical and surgical treatment options result in considerable impairment of speaking and swallowing functions, with side effects such as nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and renal damage, thereby impairing patients\\' quality of life. Thus, developing a prevention and therapeutic intervention strategy for head and neck cancer is vital. Phytochemicals have been shown to have a unique ability to protect cells from damage and modulation of cell repair. The chemopreventive activities of phytochemicals have also been demonstrated to be associated with their antioxidant properties and the induction and stimulation of intercellular communication via gap junctions, which play a role in the regulation of cancer cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, and stagnate cancer cell growth. Phytochemicals can also regulate cancer cell signaling pathways, reduce the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells, and protect normal cells during treatment, thus reducing the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The most studied of the chemopreventive effects of phytochemicals are the carotenoids and phenolics. In this review, we investigated the multiple mechanisms of carotenoids and polyphenols (PPs) for use in preventing head and neck cancer, reducing the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, improving patient survival rates, and reducing the occurrence rate of second primary cancers.A new complex of curcumin with sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin: characterization studies and in vitro evaluation of cytotoxic and antioxidant activity on HepG-2 cells. Curcumin (CR) is a natural polyphenol with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties but its therapeutic potential is substantially hindered by the rather low-water solubility and bioavailability. Thus, in this work, a new soluble inclusion complex of CR with sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBE-beta-CD) was prepared in solution and at the solid state using different preparation techniques. Results clearly indicate that CR reacts with SBE-beta-CD to form a host-guest complex with an apparent formation constant of 1455 M(-1) . Finally, an in vitro test on a human hepatic cancer cell line (HepG-2) shows that complexation positively influences curcumin anticancer and antioxidant activity.In Vitro Approaches to Study Regulation of Hepatic Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A Expression by Paclitaxel and Rifampicin. Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide however the response rate to chemotherapy treatment remains slow, mainly due to narrow therapeutic index and multidrug resistance. Paclitaxel (taxol) has a superior outcome in terms of response rates and progression-free survival. However, numerous cancer patients are resistant to this drug. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that induction of cytochrome P450 (Cyp)3a11 gene by paclitaxel is downregulated by the inflammatory mediator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, attenuates human CYP3A4 gene induction by rifampicin. Primary mouse hepatocytes were pretreated with LPS (1 ??g/ml) for 10 min, followed by paclitaxel (20 ??M) or vehicle for 24 h. RNA was extracted from the cells by trizol method followed by cDNA synthesis and analysis by real-time PCR. Paclitaxel significantly induced gene expression of Cyp3a11 (~30-fold) and this induction was attenuated in LPS-treated samples. Induction and subsequent downregulation of CYP3A enzyme can impact paclitaxel treatment in cancer patients where inflammatory mediators are activated. It has been shown that the nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), plays a role in the induction of CYP enzymes. In order to understand the mechanisms of regulation of human CYP3A4 gene, we co-transfected HepG2 cells (human liver cell line) with CYP3A4-luciferase construct and a PXR expression plasmid. The cells were then treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFalpha, followed by the prototype CYP3A inducer rifampicin. It is well established that rifampicin activates PXR, leading to CYP3A4 induction. We found that induction of CYP3A4-luciferase activity by rifampicin was significantly attenuated by TNFalpha. In conclusion, we describe herein several in vitro approaches entailing primary and cultured hepatocytes, real-time PCR, and transcriptional activation (transfection) assays to investigate the molecular regulation of CYP3A, which plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of numerous chemotherapeutic drugs. Genetic or drug-induced variation in CYP3A and/or PXR expression could contribute to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer patients.Synergistic inhibition of colon cancer cell growth by a combination of atorvastatin and phloretin. Atorvastatin (ATST), a drug commonly used to reduce the levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, is a prospective agent for the prevention of colorectal cancer in patients with hyperlipidemia. ATST in combination with functional components is a promising strategy for cancer chemoprevention. In the present study, the growth inhibitory effect of ATST combined with phloretin (PT) on SW620 and HCT116 colon cancer cells was investigated. The results of MTT assays indicated that the combination of PT and ATST markedly reduced cell survival in both cell lines compared with PT or ATST treatment administered individually. The interaction indexes between PT and ATST, which were used to analyze their interaction pattern, were computed by the median-effect equation. The interaction indexes of each PT and ATST concentration pair were <1.0, which indicated a strong synergistic effect between the two compounds. The data obtained by flow cytometry and western blot analysis of cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase indicated a synergistic effect resulted in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint. Furthermore, combined treatment with PT and ATST markedly downregulated the expression of cyclin B and upregulated the expression of phospho-cdc2 and Myt1, which suggested that the activation of cdc2 was downregulated. This combined treatment strategy enhanced the anti-cancer activity of ATST at a relatively low dosage and suggested a possible method of preventing colorectal cancer in patients with hyperlipidemia.Four new cytotoxic germacranolides from Carpesium divaricatum. In a bioassay-guided search for cytotoxic compounds from higher plants of South Korea, four new sesquiterpenes of the germacranolide type, named cardivins A (1), B (2), C (3), and D (4), have been isolated from the aerial parts of Carpesium divaricatum. Structures of these compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic techniques. Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed cytotoxicity to the human tumor cells, A-549 (nonsmall cell lung), SK-OV-3 (ovary), SK-MEL-2 (skin), XF-498 (central nervous system), and HCT-15 (colon).Curcumin and genistein: the combined effects on disease-associated CFTR mutants and their clinical implications. Genistein and curcumin are major components of Asian foods, soybean and curry turmeric respectively. These compounds have been intensively investigated for their chemical and biological features conferring their anti-cancer activity. Genistein and curcumin have also been investigated for their potentiation effects on disease-associated CFTR mutants such as ?√•√áF508 and G551D. Recently, we investigated the combined effect of genistein and curcumin on G551D-CFTR, which exhibits gating defects without abnormalities in protein synthesis or trafficking using the patch-clamp technique. We found that genistein and curcumin showed additive effects on their potentiation of G551D-CFTR in high concentration range and also, more importantly, showed a significant synergistic effect in their minimum concentration ranges. These results are consistent with the idea that multiple mechanisms are involved in the action of these CFTR potentiators. In this review, we revisit the pharmacology of genistein and curcumin on CFTR and also propose new pharmaceutical implications of combined use of these compounds in the development of drugs for CF pharmacotherapy.Anti-tumor activity of verbascoside loaded gold nanoparticles. Verbascoside (VB), a major bioactive constituent of the Tsoong herb, has attracted a great deal of attention due to its pharmacological properties. In this study, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of VB-loaded gold nanoparticles (VB-Au) on the growth of K562 cells both in vitro and in vivo. We found that, in contrast with the same concentration of gold nanoparticles (Au) or VB, VB-Au significantly decreased the viability of K562 cells and promoted the apoptosis of tumor cells. A tumor implantation mouse model further showed that the intravenous injection of VB-Au effectively inhibited the growth and induced the apoptosis of tumor cells. In conclusion, our results collectively demonstrate that VB-Au nanoparticles provide an effective strategy to control tumor cell growth.Autophagy Accompanied with Bisdemethoxycurcumin-induced Apoptosis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cells. To investigate the effects of bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, A549, and the highly metastatic lung cancer 95D cells. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the effect of BDMC on cytotoxicity. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate apoptosis. Western blot analysis, electron microscopy, and quantification of GFP-LC3 punctuates were used to test the effect of BDMC on autophagy and apoptosis of lung cancer cells. BDMC inhibited the viability of NSCLC cells, but had no cytotoxic effects on lung small airway epithelial cells (SAECs). The apoptotic cell death induced by BDMC was accompanied with the induction of autophagy in NSCLC cells. Blockage of autophagy by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) repressed the growth inhibitory effects and induction of apoptosis by BDMC. In addition, BDMC treatment significantly decreased smoothened (SMO) and the transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) expression. Furthermore, depletion of Gli1 by siRNA and cyclopamine (a specific SMO inhibitor) induced autophagy. Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been implicated in several human cancers, including lung cancers. The present findings provide direct evidence that BDMC-induced autophagy plays a pro-death role in NSCLC, in part, by inhibiting Hedgehog signaling.Inhibition of Breast Cancer Cell Migration by Cyclotides Isolated from Pombalia calceolaria. Two new bracelet cyclotides from roots of Pombalia calceolaria with potential anticancer activity have been characterized in this work. The cyclotides Poca A and B (1 and 2) and the previously known CyO4 (3) were de novo sequenced by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (MS). The MS2 spectra were examined and the amino acid sequences were determined. The purified peptides were tested for their cytotoxicity and effects on cell migration of MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. The isolated cyclotides reduced the number of cancer cells by more than 80% at 20 ??M, and the concentration-related cytotoxic responses were observed with IC50 values of 1.8, 2.7, and 9.8 ??M for Poca A (1), Poca B (2), and CyO4 (3), respectively. Additionally, the inhibition of cell migration (wound-healing assay) exhibited that CyO4 (3) presents an interesting activity profile, in being able to inhibit cell migration (50%) at a subtoxic concentration (2 ??M). The distribution of these cyclotides in the roots was analyzed by MALDI imaging, demonstrating that all three compounds are present in the phloem and cortical parenchyma regions.Iso-suillin from Suillus flavus Induces Apoptosis in Human Small Cell Lung Cancer H446 Cell Line. The suillin isoform iso-suillin is a natural substance isolated from a petroleum ether extract of the fruiting bodies of the mushroom Suillus flavus. Previous studies have found its inhibition effect on some cancer cells, and we aimed to study its effects on human small cell lung cancer H446 cell line. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay. Cellular morphological changes (apoptosis and necrosis) were evaluated using an electron microscope and Hoechst 33258 staining detected by the inverted microscope. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting analysis. Here, we describe the ability of iso-suillin to inhibit the growth of H446 cells in time- and dose-dependent way. Iso-suillin had no obvious impact on normal human lymphocyte proliferation at low concentrations (9.09, 18.17, or 36.35 ??mol/L) but promoted lymphocyte proliferation at a high concentration (72.70 ??mol/L). After treatment of different concentrations of iso-suillin (6.82, 13.63, or 20.45 ??mol/L), the apoptosis rate of H446 cells increased with increasing concentrations of iso-suillin (16.70%, 35.54%, and 49.20%, respectively, all P < 0.05 compared with the control), and the expression of related apoptotic proteins in the mitochondrial pathway including cytochrome c and caspase-9 were up-regulated compared with the control (all P < 0.05). On the contrary, Bcl-2/Bax ratio was down-regulated compared with the control. Besides, the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins in the death receptor apoptosis pathway, including Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain and caspase-8, and the expression of caspase-3, a downstream regulatory protein of apoptosis, were also increased compared with the control (all P < 0.05). Inhibitors of caspase-9 and caspase-8 reversed the apoptosis process in H446 cells to varying degrees. These results suggest that iso-suillin could induce H446 cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and the death-receptor pathway. Therefore, iso-suillin might have a potential application as a novel drug for lung cancer treatment.Inhibitory effect of topical application of a green tea polyphenol fraction on tumor initiation and promotion in mouse skin. A green tea polyphenol fraction was evaluated for its ability to inhibit tumor initiation by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and tumor promotion by a phorbol ester in the skin of CD-1 mice. Topical application of the green tea polyphenol fraction inhibited benzo[a]pyrene- and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene-induced tumor initiation as well as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced tumor promotion. Topical application of the green tea polyphenol fraction also inhibited TPA-induced inflammation, ornithine decarboxylase activity, hyperplasia and hydrogen peroxide formation. Studies with individual polyphenolic compounds in green tea indicated that topical application of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin gallate inhibited TPA-induced inflammation in mouse epidermis.MicroRNA-7 functions as a tumor-suppressor gene by regulating ILF2 in pancreatic carcinoma. Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2? (ILF2) has been found to be markedly upregulated in pancreatic carcinoma and is involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic carcinoma. Thus, ILF2 may be a potential target for therapy. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms of ILF2 in pancreatic carcinoma remain largely elusive. In the present study, we demonstrated that ILF2 functioned as an oncogene and regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition? (EMT)-associated genes in pancreatic carcinoma PANC-1 cells. MicroRNA-7? (miR-7) suppressed ILF2 mRNA expression and the protein level in PANC-1 cells. Contrary to ILF2, miRNA-7 functioned as a tumor-suppressor gene and negatively regulated EMT-associated genes in the PANC-1 cells. Curcumin, a polyphenol natural product isolated from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, has emerged as a promising anticancer therapeutic agent. We found that treatment with curcumin increased miR-7 expression and suppressed ILF2 protein in the PANC-1 cells. Thus, we identified ILF2 as a new downstream target gene of curcumin. The results revealed that ILF2 is regulated by miR-7 and suggest that downregulation of miR-7 may be an important factor for the ILF2 overexpression in pancreatic carcinoma.Farmer to pharmacist: curcumin as an anti-invasive and antimetastatic agent for the treatment of cancer. A huge number of compounds are widely distributed in nature and many of these possess medicinal/biological/pharmacological activity. Curcumin, a polyphenol derived from the rhizomes (underground stems) of Curcuma longa Linn (a member of the ginger family, commonly known as turmeric) is a culinary spice and therapeutic used in India for thousands of years to induce color and flavor in food as well as to treat a wide array of diseases. The origin of turmeric as spice and folklore medicine is so old that it is lost in legend. Curcumin has many beneficial pharmacological effects which includes, but are not limited with, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, antiangiogenic, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, and antidiabetic activities. Most importantly curcumin possesses immense antitumorigenic effect. It prevents tumor invasion and metastasis in a number of animal models, including models of lung, liver, stomach, colon, breast, esophageal cancer etc. Invasion and metastasis are considered as one of the hallmarks in cancer biology. The pertinent recent applications of curcumin as anti-invasive and antimetastatic agent in in vitro and in vivo and ex vivo studies as well as associated molecular mechanisms have been discussed in this review. Curcumin has also demonstrated the ability to improve patient outcomes in clinical trials.Xanthorrhizol induces apoptosis via the up-regulation of bax and p53 in HeLa cells. Xanthorrhizol is a sesquiterpenoid compound extracted from Curcuma xanthorrhiza, which is known locally as Temulawak. Traditionally, C. xanthorrhiza was found to have antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity. The rhizome has also been used to treat inflammation in postpartum uterine bleeding. An antiproliferative assay using methylene blue staining revealed that xanthorrhizol inhibited the proliferation of the cervical cancer cell line HeLa with an EC50 value of 6.16 microg/ml. Xanthorrhizol significantly increased apoptosis in HeLa cells, as evaluated by the Tdt-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay and nuclear morphology by Hoechst 33258 staining. Western blot analysis, which was further confirmed by the immunostaining results, implied an up-regulation of tumor suppressor protein p53 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, following the treatment with xanthorrhizol. Xanthorrhizol, however, did not affect the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 and the viral oncoprotein, E6. Hence, xanthorrhizol is a promising antiproliferative and anticancer agent which induces p53 and Bax-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cervical cancer cells.Phytochemical Modulation of Apoptosis and Autophagy: Strategies to Overcome Chemoresistance in Leukemic Stem Cells in the Bone Marrow Microenvironment. Advances in scientific research and targeted treatment regimes have improved survival rates for many cancers over the past few decades. However, for some types of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia, mortality rates have continued to rise, with chemoresistance in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) being a major contributing factor. Most cancer drug therapies act by inducing apoptosis in dividing cells but are ineffective in targeting quiescent LSCs. Niches in the bone marrow, known as leukemic niches, behave as sanctuaries where LSCs acquire drug resistance. This review explores the role of the bone marrow environment in the maintenance of LSCs and its contribution to chemoresistance and considers current research on the potential use of phytochemicals to overcome chemoresistance through the modulation of signaling pathways involved in the survival and death of leukemic clonal cells and/or leukemic stem cells. Phytochemicals from traditional Chinese medicine, namely baicalein, chrysin, wogonin (constituents of Scutellaria baicalensis ), curcumin (a constituent of Curcuma longa), and resveratrol (a constituent of Polygonum cuspidatum h√•? zh?ng, ) have been shown to induce apoptosis in leukemic cell lines, with curcumin and resveratrol also causing cell death via the induction of autophagy (a nonapoptotic pathway). In order to be effective in eliminating LSCs, it is important to target signaling pathways (such as Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog). Resveratrol has been reported to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells through the inhibition of the Notch and Sonic hedgehog signaling pathways, therefore showing potential to affect LSCs. While these findings are of interest, there is a lack of reported research on the modulatory effect of phytochemicals on the autophagic cell death pathway in leukemia, and on the signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of LSCs, highlighting the need for further work in these areas.Curcumin reverses T cell-mediated adaptive immune dysfunctions in tumor-bearing hosts. Immune dysfunction is well documented during tumor progression and likely contributes to tumor immune evasion. CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are involved in antigen-specific tumor destruction and CD4(+) T cells are essential for helping this CD8(+) T cell-dependent tumor eradication. Tumors often target and inhibit T-cell function to escape from immune surveillance. This dysfunction includes loss of effector and memory T cells, bias towards type 2 cytokines and expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells. Curcumin has previously been shown to have antitumor activity and some research has addressed the immunoprotective potential of this plant-derived polyphenol in tumor-bearing hosts. Here we examined the role of curcumin in the prevention of tumor-induced dysfunction of T cell-based immune responses. We observed severe loss of both effector and memory T-cell populations, downregulation of type 1 and upregulation of type 2 immune responses and decreased proliferation of effector T cells in the presence of tumors. Curcumin, in turn, prevented this loss of T cells, expanded central memory T cell (T(CM))/effector memory T cell (T(EM)) populations, reversed the type 2 immune bias and attenuated the tumor-induced inhibition of T-cell proliferation in tumor-bearing hosts. Further investigation revealed that tumor burden upregulated Treg cell populations and stimulated the production of the immunosuppressive cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10 in these cells. Curcumin, however, inhibited the suppressive activity of Treg cells by downregulating the production of TGF-beta and IL-10 in these cells. More importantly, curcumin treatment enhanced the ability of effector T cells to kill cancer cells. Overall, our observations suggest that the unique properties of curcumin may be exploited for successful attenuation of tumor-induced suppression of cell-mediated immune responses.Curcumin and lung cancer--a review. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the most important component of the spice turmeric and is derived from the rhizome of the East Indian plant Curcuma longa. Curcumin has been used extensively in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries, as it is nontoxic and has a variety of therapeutic properties including antioxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic activities. Recently, curcumin has been widely studied for its anticancer properties via its effects on a variety of biological pathways involved in apoptosis, tumor proliferation, chemo- and radiotherapy sensitization, tumor invasion, and metastases. Curcumin can be an effective adjunct in treating solid organ tumors due to its properties of regulating oncogenes like p53, egr-1, c-myc, bcl-XL, etc. transcription factors like NF-kB, STAT-3, and AP-1 protein kinases like MAPK and enzymes like COX and LOX. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Seventy-five percent of lung cancer presents at an advanced stage where the existing treatment is not very effective and may result in tremendous patient morbidity. As a result, there is a significant interest in developing adjunctive chemotherapies to augment currently available treatment protocols, which may allow decreased side effects and toxicity without compromising therapeutic efficacy. Curcumin is one such potential candidate, and this review presents an overview of the current in vitro and in vivo studies of curcumin in lung cancer.Frequent and simultaneous epigenetic inactivation of TP53 pathway genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the most frequent alterations in patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Using methylation bead arrays we analyzed the methylation status of 807 genes implicated in cancer in a group of ALL samples at diagnosis . We found that 154 genes were methylated in more than 10% of ALL samples. Interestingly, the expression of 13 genes implicated in the TP53 pathway was downregulated by hypermethylation. Direct or indirect activation of TP53 pathway with 5-aza-2\\'-deoxycitidine, Curcumin or Nutlin-3 induced an increase in apoptosis of ALL cells. The results obtained with the initial group of 48 patients was validated retrospectively in a second cohort of 200 newly diagnosed ALL patients. Methylation of at least 1 of the 13 genes implicated in the TP53 pathway was observed in 78% of the patients, which significantly correlated with a higher relapse and mortality (p<0.001) rate being an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)  in the multivariate analysis. All these findings indicate that TP53 pathway is altered by epigenetic mechanisms in the majority of ALL patients and correlates with prognosis. Treatments with compounds that may reverse the epigenetic abnormalities or activate directly the p53 pathway represent a new therapeutic alternative for patients with ALL.Curcumin potentiates doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cardiac muscle cells through generation of reactive oxygen species. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapy agent. The major adverse effect of DOX treatment in cancer patients is the onset of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are proposed to be responsible for DOX cardiotoxicity. Curcumin, a natural compound extracted from Curcuma Longa L., is known for its anti-oxidant properties. It has been identified as increased apoptosis in several cancer cell lines in combination with doxorubicin, but there are few studies about the effect of curcumin and doxorubicin on normal cardiac cells. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of curcumin on apoptosis induced by DOX in cardiac muscle cells. Pretreatment with curcumin significantly increased DOX-induced apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells through down regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of caspase-8 and caspase-9. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased significantly after 1h pretreatment with curcumin. As well, curcumin increases ROS generation by DOX. In response to DOX, NF-kB was activated. However, curcumin was able to inhibit NF-kB activation. In conclusion, our results indicated that pretreatment with nontoxic concentrations of curcumin sensitized H9c2 cells to DOX-mediated apoptosis by generation of ROS.Phloretin induces apoptosis of human esophageal cancer via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. 2,4,6-trihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propiophenone (phloretin) is found in apple tree leaves and the Manchurian apricot, and is a potent compound that exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumor activities. However, the effect of phloretin on esophageal cancer cells is not well-defined. The present study aimed to examine whether and how phloretin induced apoptosis in human esophageal cancer cells. EC-109 cells were cultured in Dulbecco\\'s modified Eagle\\'s medium and incubated with 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 ??g/ml phloretin for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Cell proliferation was measured by an MTT assay. Cell apoptosis rate was measured using flow cytometric analysis subsequent to propidium iodide (PI) staining. The protein expression levels were determined by western blot analysis. It was found that phloretin significantly decreased viable cell numbers in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced apoptosis in EC-109 cells. Additionally, phloretin exhibited potent anticancer activity in vitro, as evidenced by the downregulation of the anti-apoptosis-associated molecule B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) and an increase in the levels of the apoptosis-associated molecules bcl-2-like protein 4 and tumor protein p53. Phloretin treatment also affected the expression of apoptotic protease activating factor-1, the protein product of the direct binding of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein with low PI to the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. The present results indicated that phloretin may inhibit EC-109 cell growth by inducing apoptosis, which may be mediated through a mitochondria-dependent pathway.Formononetin inhibits neuroinflammation and increases estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) protein expression in BV2 microglia. Formononetin is a bioactive non-steroidal polyphenol found in a variety of plants. In this study we evaluated the effects of formononetin on neuroinflammation in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. Results showed that formononetin significantly reduced the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta, nitrite and PGE2, as well as protein levels of iNOS and COX-2. Reporter gene assays showed that formononetin produced inhibition of NF-kB luciferase activity in HEK293 cells stimulated with TNF-alpha. Immunoblotting experiments revealed an inhibition of IKKalpha phosphorylation, with the resultant attenuation of phosphorylation and degradation of IkBalpha following LPS stimulation. Formononetin also produced an inhibition of nuclear translocation and DNA binding by NF-kB following LPS stimulation. RNAi experiments showed that transfection of BV2 microglia with ERbeta siRNA resulted in the loss of anti-inflammatory action of formononetin. MTT assay and MAP2 immunoreactivity experiments showed that formononetin produced significant neuroprotective activity by preventing BV2 microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity to HT22 neurons. Investigations on the effect of formononetin on MCF7 breast cancer cells revealed that, while the compound significantly increased ER-luciferase activity, its effects on proliferation were modest. This study has established that formononetin inhibits neuroinflammation by targeting NF-kB signalling pathway in BV2 microglia, possibly through mechanisms involving ERbeta. Formononetin appears to modulate ERbeta in MCF7 breast cancer cells with limited proliferative effect. Formononetin could therefore serve as a chemical scaffold for the development of novel compounds which have selective neuroprotective actions in the brain.Resveratrol inhibits Hexokinases II mediated glycolysis in non-small cell lung cancer via targeting Akt signaling pathway. Deregulation of glycolysis was often observed in human cancer cells. In the present study, we reported resveratrol, a small polyphenol, which has been intensively studied in various tumor models, has a profound anti-tumor effect on human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via regulation of glycolysis. Resveratrol impaired hexokinase II (HK2)-mediated glycolysis, and markedly inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of NSCLC cells. Exposure to resveratrol decreased EGFR and downstream kinases Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, we revealed that resveratrol impaired glucose metabolism by mainly inhibiting expression of HK2 mediated by the Akt signaling pathway, and exogenous overexpression of constitutively activated Akt1 in NSCLC cells substantially rescued resveratrol-induced glycolysis suppression. The in vivo data indicated that resveratrol obviously suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Our results suggest targeting HK2 or metabolic enzymes appears to be a new approach for clinical NSCLC prevention or treatment.Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist triptorelin and antagonist cetrorelix inhibit EGF-induced c-fos expression in human gynecological cancers. Spontaneous and epidermal growth-factor-induced proliferation of human gynecological cancer cell lines is dose- and time-dependently reduced by treatment with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist triptorelin and antagonist Cetrorelix. This antiproliferative activity is probably directly mediated through the LHRH receptors expressed by the tumor cells interacting with growth-factor-dependent mitogenic signal transduction. We have examined whether epidermal growth-factor (EGF)-induced expression of the early response gene c-fos is reduced by LHRH analogs. Human endometrial (Ishikawa, Hec-1A), ovarian (EFO-21, EFO-27, SK-OV-3), and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) were rendered quiescent by incubation (72 h) in the absence of fetal calf serum and phenol red. This was followed by a 15-min incubation in the absence or presence of the LHRH agonist triptorelin (100 nM) or the antagonist Cetrorelix (100 nM) before the cells were stimulated for 10 min with EGF (100 nM). C-fos mRNA expression was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using a synthetic DNA fragment as internal standard. C-Fos protein synthesis was determined by SDS-PAGE and semi-quantitative Western blotting. In cells derived from endometrial and ovarian cancer, maximal c-fos mRNA expression (seven- to ninefold over basal level) was obtained 30 min after EGF stimulation. In the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 this effect was obtained 60 min after EGF treatment. In all of the lines expressing LHRH receptor, EGF-induced c-fos mRNA expression as well as c-Fos protein synthesis was dose-dependently reduced by treatment with LHRH agonists and antagonists. At 100 nM concentrations of the LHRH analogs, c-fos expression was reduced to baseline levels. No effect of LHRH analogs on EGF-induced c-fos expression was observed in the ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3, which does not express the LHRH receptor. These results suggest that the binding of LHRH agonists and antagonists to their receptors inhibits the mitogenic signal transduction pathway of the EGF receptor in endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cell lines. The coupling of both signal transduction systems mediates the antiproliferative effect of LHRH analogs.In vitro evaluation of antiproliferative effect of ethyl gallate against human oral squamous carcinoma cell line KB. Although some polyphenols are known to possess anticancer activity against different cancer cell lines through induction of apoptosis, the mode of antiproliferative effect of ethyl gallate against human oral squamous carcinoma cell line KB was not studied until now. Therefore, the antiproliferative effect of ethyl gallate was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in comparison with the reference drug paclitaxel. Generation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, DNA damage and apoptosis were determined using 2,7-diacetyldichlorofluorescein fluorescence, uptake of rhodamine-123 by mitochondria, comet assay and acridine orange/ethidium bromide dual-dye staining method. Both ethyl gallate and paclitaxel exhibited cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration for ethyl gallate was 30 and 20 ??g/mL for paclitaxel. A volume of 50 ??g/mL of ethyl gallate was found to be significantly effective (P < 0.05) in controlling the cancer cell proliferation leading to acute apoptosis.Comparison of inhibitory effect of curcumin nanoparticles and free curcumin in human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene expression in breast cancer. Telomerase is expressed in most cancers, including breast cancer. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound that obtained from the herb of Curcuma longa, has many anticancer effects. But, its effect is low due to poor water solubility. In order to improve its solubility and drug delivery, we have utilized a beta-cyclodextrin-curcumin inclusion complex. To evaluate cytotoxic effects of cyclodextrin-curcumin and free curcumin, MTT assay was done. Cells were treated with equal concentration of cyclodextrin-curcumin and free curcumin. Telomerase gene expression level in two groups was compared by Real-time PCR. MTT assay demonstrated that beta-cyclodextrin-curcumin enhanced curcumin delivery in T47D breast cancer cells. The level of telomerase gene expression in cells treated with cyclodextrin-curcumin was lower than that of cells treated with free curcumin (P=0.001). RESULTS are suggesting that cyclodextrin-curcumin complex can be more effective than free curcumin in inhibition of telomerase expressionAntiproliferative effect of flavonoids from the halophyte Vitex rotundifolia on human cancer cells. Three flavonoids, luteolin (1), vitexicarpin (2) and artemetin (3), from the salt marsh plant Vitex rotundifolia, were tested for their anti-proliferative activities in AGS, MCF-7 and HT-29 human cancer cell lines and compared with the control using MTT assay. Among them, 2 was most effective with an IC50 of 6.9 and 22.8 microM against AGS and HT-29 cells, respectively. Inaddition, mRNA expression levels of major apoptosis-related genes such as p21, p53, Bcl-2 andBax in AGS cells were evaluated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compound 2 not only enhanced most remarkably the expression level of tumor suppressor genes p53 and p21, and pro-apoptotic gene Bax at a concentration of 25 microM, but also suppressed the expression level of antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 to 20% at the same concentration, thus shifting the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in favor of apoptosisLicochalcone A induces apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress via a phospholipase Cgamma1-, Ca(2+)-, and reactive oxygen species-dependent pathway in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Licochalcone A (LicA), an estrogenic flavonoid, induces apoptosis in multiple types of cancer cells. In this study, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of LicA were investigated in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. LicA induced apoptotic cell death, activation of caspase-4, -9, and -3, and expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated proteins, including C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Inhibition of ER stress by CHOP knockdown or treatment with the ER stress inhibitors, salubrinal and 4-phenylbutyric acid, reduced LicA-induced cell death. LicA also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine reduced LicA-induced cell death and CHOP expression. In addition, LicA increased the levels of cytosolic Ca(2+), which was blocked by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (an antagonist of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor) and BAPTA-AM (an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator). 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and BAPTA-AM inhibited LicA-induced cell death. Interestingly, LicA induced phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) and inhibition of PLCgamma1 reduced cell death and ER stress. Moreover, the multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sorafenib and sunitinib, reduced LicA-induced cell death, ER stress, and cytosolic Ca(2+) and ROS accumulation. Finally, LicA induced phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and c-Met receptor and inhibition of both receptors by co-transfection with VEGFR2 and c-Met siRNAs reversed LicA-induced cell death, Ca(2+) increase, and CHOP expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that induction of ER stress via a PLCgamma1-, Ca(2+)-, and ROS-dependent pathway may be an important mechanism by which LicA induces apoptosis in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Reversion effects of curcumin on multidrug resistance of MNNG/HOS human osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo through regulation of P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) gene is a kind of ATP-dependent drug transporter, which plays important roles in multidrug resistance (MDR) of human cancers, such as osteosarcoma. Curcumin is a natural phenolic coloring compound originating from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa, which is proved to possess antitumor biological activities including reversion of MDR. However, the effect and molecular mechanisms of curcumin to osteosarcoma MDR remain unclear. We established a human osteosarcoma drug-resistant cell line MNNG/HOS/MTX by pulse exposure to methotrexate (MTX) and verified that the new cell lines were cross-resistant to other anticancer agents. Then, according to the cytotoxicity assay, we reversed MDR of MNNG/HOS/MTX by 30 ??mol/L curcumin, and detected the mechanisms of curcumin reversing MDR through Real-time PCR, Western blotting assay, and Rhodamine123 (Rh123) transport test. Finally, we evaluated the effect of curcumin reversing MDR in vivo by MNNG/HOS/MTX cells xenograft-nude mice model. MNNG/HOS/MTX was proved to be a human osteosarcoma MDR cell line. MTT tumor chemosensitivity test indicates that 30 ??mol/L curcumin attenuates the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and resistance index (RI) to MTX, diamminedichloroplatinum (DDP), adriamycin (ADM), ifosfamide (IFO), and epirubicin (EPI) in MNNG/HOS/MTX cells (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that curcumin down-regulated P-gp expression of MNNG/HOS/MTX cells. Rh123 transport test showed that curcumin inhibited the transport function of P-gp in vitro. In vivo studies showed that curcumin displayed the features of sensitizing antitumor drugs and inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of osteosarcoma MDR cells. Down-regulation of P-gp and inhibition of the function of P-gp efflux pump may contribute to MDR reversion induced by curcumin in vitro and in vivo.A flavonoid glycoside isolated from Smilax china L. rhizome in vitro anticancer effects on human cancer cell lines. The anticancer activity of eight crude extracts of Smilax china L. rhizome (SCR) against HeLa cells was assessed by MTT assay and clonogenic assay, the fraction rich in flavonoids had show good activity against HeLa cells. A bioassay-guided separation on this extract lead to the detection of kaempferol-7-O-beta-D-glucoside (KG), which belongs to flavonoid glycoside, displayed marked anticancer activity. We evaluated its in vitro cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effect in a panel of established cancer cell lines by MTT assay and clonogenic assay. KG induces A375 and HL60 cells apoptosis, which was demonstrated by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation and flow cytometric analysis. Fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33258 showed fragmentation and condensation of chromatin in the A375 and HL60 cells. Flow cytometric analysis shown that A375 and HL60 cells treated with KG resulted in the appearance of a hypodiploid peak (A0 region), probably due to the presence of apoptosing cells and/or apoptotic bodies with DNA content less than 2n. Quantitation of the hypodiploid cells shows a dose-dependent response to KG, and this result is in good accordance with that of the DNA fragmentation assay by agarose gel electrophoresis. Our results suggested that cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase and induce apoptosis as a mechanism by which KG exerts an antiproliferative effect.Curcumin is an inhibitor of p300 histone acetylatransferase. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and p300/CBP in particular, have been implicated in cancer cell growth and survival, and as such, HATs represent novel, therapeutically relevant molecular targets for drug development. In this study, we demonstrate that the small molecule natural product curcumin, whose medicinal properties have long been recognized in India and Southeast Asia, is a selective HAT inhibitor. Furthermore the data indicate that alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl groups in the curcumin side chain function as Michael reaction sites and that the Michael reaction acceptor functionality of curcumin is required for its HAT-inhibitory activity. In cells, curcumin promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of p300 and the closely related CBP protein without affecting the HATs PCAF or GCN5. In addition to inducing p300 degradation curcumin inhibited the acetyltransferase activity of purified p300 as assessed using either histone H3 or p53 as substrate. Radiolabeled curcumin formed a covalent association with p300, and tetrahydrocurcumin displayed no p300 inhibitory activity, consistent with a Michael reaction-dependent mechanism. Finally, curcumin was able to effectively block histone hyperacetylation in both PC3-M prostate cancer cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes induced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275. These data thus identify the medicinal natural product curcumin as a novel lead compound for development of possibly therapeutic, p300/CBP-specific HAT inhibitors.Curcumin inhibits trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-induced colitis in rats by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Curcumin is a widely used spice with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. It has been reported that curcumin held therapeutic effects on experimental colitis by inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear receptor with anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects and its activation may inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Several studies have shown that PPARgamma ligands had an important therapeutic effect in colitis. However there is no report about the alteration of PPARgamma in trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis treated with curcumin. In this study, we administered curcumin (30 mg/kg/day) by intraperitoneal injection immediately after colitis was induced and the injection lasted for two weeks. have evaluated the effects of curcumin on the colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS). Curcumin (30 mg/kg d) was administered by intraperitoneal just after colitis was induced and lasted for two weeks. Therapeutic effects of dexamethasone (Dex, 2 mg/kg d) alone and the combined effects of curcumin+Dex were also examined. We found that curcumin improved long-term survival rate of disease-bearing rats, promoted rat body weight recovery, and decreased macroscopic scores of the colitis. The expression levels of PPARgamma, 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) were all increased, but the expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was decreased in rats after administration of curcumin. Treatment with Dex improved PPARgamma expression and inhibited the expression of COX-2, 15d-PGJ(2) and PGE(2). Combined effects of curcumin+Dex were similar to that of Dex. In summary, curcumin showed therapeutic effects on TNBS-induced colitis and the mechanisms by which curcumin exerts its effects may involve activation of PPARgamma and its ligands.Resistance to apoptosis of HCW-2 cells can be overcome by curcumin- or vincristine-induced mitotic catastrophe. The term mitotic catastrophe has recently become widely used to describe a form of death affecting many cancer cells, which, because of severe DNA or mitotic spindle damage, are not able to bypass mitosis. We show here that cells of the HL-60-derived HCW-2 line highly resistant to apoptosis, upon treatment with curcumin or vincristine, undergo mitotic catastrophe that is finalized by caspase 3 activation and oligonucleosomal DNA degradation. Curcumin is a natural dye, derived from Curcuma longa that has been shown to induce cell death in many cancer cells. Both treatments decrease cell proliferation and cell survival, arrest cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and induce morphological changes characterized by cell enlargement and micronucleation. Catastrophic cells comprise a separate subpopulation with less than 4C DNA, as evidenced by flow and scanning cytometry. This subpopulation is MPM-2 positive. Thymidine block increased the number of cell arrested in the G2/M phase of cell cycle and curcumin effectiveness as an inducer of mitotic catastrophe. Curcumin, but not vincristine, acts on HCW-2 cells by inhibiting the expression of survivin, a modulator of cell division and apoptosis in cancer. Altogether our results show that apoptosis resistance can be overcome by inducing mitotic catastrophe in HCW-2 cells.Inhibitory effects of curcumin on protein kinase C activity induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate in NIH 3T3 cells. Curcumin is a dietary pigment responsible for the yellow color of curry. It is a potent inhibitor of tumor promotion induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in mouse skin. When mouse fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3) were treated with TPA alone, protein kinase C (PKC) translocated from the cytosolic fraction to the particulate fraction. Treatment with 15 or 20 microns curcumin for 15 min inhibited TPA-induced PKC activity in particulate fraction by 26 or 60% and did not affect the level of PKC protein. Curcumin also inhibited PKC activity in both cytosolic and particulate fractions in vitro by competing with phosphatidylserine. However, the inhibitory effect of curcumin was reduced after preincubation with the thiol compounds. These findings suggest that the suppression of PKC activity may contribute to the molecular mechanism of inhibition of TPA-induced tumor promotion by curcumin.Isoliquiritigenin inhibits the growth of prostate cancer. Isoliquiritigenin, one of the components in the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra L., is a member of the flavonoids, which are known to have an anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of isoliquiritigenin on prostate cancer in vitro. DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines were used as targets. We examined the effects of isoliquiritigenin on cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and cell cycle-regulating gene expression. Further, we investigated the effects of isoliquiritigenin on the GADD153 mRNA and protein expression, and promoter activity. Isoliquiritigenin significantly inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis indicated that isoliquiritigenin induced S and G2/M phase arrest. Isoliquiritigenin enhanced the expression of GADD153 mRNA and protein associated with cell cycle arrest. Further, isoliquiritigenin stimulated transcriptional activity of GADD153 promoter dose-dependently. These findings suggest that isoliquiritigenin is a candidate agent for the treatment of prostate cancer and GADD153 may play an important role in isoliquiritigenin-induced cell cycle arrest and cell growth inhibition.Ethanolic Extract of Bark from Salix aegyptiaca Ameliorates 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced Colon Carcinogenesis in Mice by Reducing Oxidative Stress. We have previously shown that ethanolic extract from bark (EEB) of Salix aegyptiaca (Musk Willow) can inhibit proliferation and motility and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Tandem mass spectrometry revealed EEB to be rich in catechin, catechol, and salicin. The present study investigated the chemopreventive effect of HPLC-fingerprinted EEB on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation in mice. DMH (20 mg/kg body weight) was weekly injected subcutaneously to mice for the first 2 weeks. EEB (100 and 400 mg/kg body weight) was provided orally from the 7th to 14th week, after which colon tissues were evaluated histologically and biochemically. DMH treatment induced high number of ACF EEB significantly reduced the number and multiplicity of ACF, along with a restoration in goblet cells and mucin accumulation. EEB supplementation improved the markers of inflammation (myeloperoxidase and neutrophil infiltration) and oxidative stress. More importantly, EEB amplified apoptosis of neoplastic cells in the colon mucosa of DMH-treated mice. It also lowered levels of markers for early transformation events such as EGFR, nuclear beta-catenin, and COX-2 in colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and HCT-116. The innocuity of EEB (up to 1600 mg/kg) to mice reinforces its potential as a chemopreventive agent.In Vitro Anticancer Activity of a Nonpolar Fraction from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino. Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino (GpM) has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of various diseases including cancer. Most previous studies have focused primarily on polar fractions of GpM for anticancer activities. In this study, a nonpolar fraction EA1.3A from GpM showed potent growth inhibitory activities against four cancer cell lines with IC50 ranging from 31.62√å√∂√å√Ñ√å¬™??g/mL to 38.02√å√∂√å√Ñ√å¬™??g/mL. Furthermore, EA1.3A also inhibited the growth of breast cancer cell MDA-MB-453 time-dependently, as well as its colony formation ability. EA1.3A induced apoptosis on MDA-MB-453 cells both dose-dependently and time-dependently as analyzed by flow cytometry and verified by western blotting analysis of apoptosis marker cleaved nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP). Additionally, EA1.3A induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Chemical components analysis of EA1.3A by GC-MS revealed that this nonpolar fraction from GpM contains 10 compounds including four alkaloids, three organic esters, two terpenes, and one catechol substance, and all these compounds have not been reported in GpM. In summary, the nonpolar fraction EA1.3A from GpM inhibited cancer cell growth through induction of apoptosis and regulation of cell cycle progression. Our study shed light on new chemical bases for the anticancer activities of GpM and feasibilities to develop new anticancer agents from this widely used medicinal plant.Antiproliferative and Antiestrogenic Activities of Bonediol an Alkyl Catechol from Bonellia macrocarpa. The purpose of this study was to investigate antiproliferative activity of bonediol, an alkyl catechol isolated from the Mayan medicinal plant Bonellia macrocarpa. Bonediol was assessed for growth inhibition of androgen-sensitive (LNCaP), androgen-insensitive (PC-3), and metastatic androgen-insensitive (PC-3M) human prostate tumor cells toxicity on normal cell line (HEK 293) was also evaluated. Hedgehog pathway was evaluated and competitive 3H-estradiol ligand binding assay was performed. Additionally, antioxidant activity on Nrf2-ARE pathway was evaluated. Bonediol induced a growth inhibition on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 from 8.5 to 20.6). Interestingly, bonediol binds to both estrogen receptors (ERalpha  and ERbeta) and displaces the native ligand E2 (17beta-estradiol). No significant activity was found in the Hedgehog pathway. Additionally, activity of bonediol on Nrf2-ARE pathway suggested that bonediol could induce oxidative stress and activation of detoxification enzymes. We propose that the compound bonediol may serve as a potential chemopreventive treatment with therapeutic potential against prostate cancer.One-pot laccase-catalysed synthesis of 5,6-dihydroxylated benzo[b]furans and catechol derivatives, and their anticancer activity. A commercial laccase, Suberase?√•? from Novozymes, was used to catalyse the synthesis of 5,6-dihydroxylated benzo[b]furans and catechol derivatives. The yields were, in some cases, similar to or better than that obtained by other enzymatic, chemical or electrochemical syntheses. The synthesised derivatives were screened against renal (TK10), melanoma (UACC62), breast (MCF7) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines. GI50, TGI and LC50 are reported for the first time. Anticancer screening showed that the cytostatic effects of the 5,6-dihydroxylated benzo[b]furans were most effective against the melanoma (UACC62) cancer cell line with several compounds exhibiting potent growth inhibitory activities, of which two compounds had better activity than the anticancer agent etoposide . One compound exhibited potent activity against the renal (TK10) cancer cell line and two exhibited potent activity  against the breast (MCF7) cancer cell line. These results encourage further studies of the 5,6-dihydroxylated benzo[b]furans for their potential application in anticancer therapy.Idaein chloride induced p53 dependent apoptosis in cervical cancer cells through inhibition of viral oncoproteins. Host dependent expression of early HPV oncoproteins, E6 and E7 play central role in the formation of cervical carcinoma. Presently, we have shown that the cyanidin analog, idaein chloride treatment induced dose dependent apoptosis (IC50?√å√ô=?√å√ô2.579?√å√ô??g/ml) in HPV positive - HeLa cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed arrest of cell cycle at G1 phase with an increased sub G1 cell population on 12th h of exposure. The recorded reduced expression levels of cell cycle proteins - cyclin D, cdk 4 and cdk 6 confirmed the occurrence of cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. In addition, the idaein chloride significantly inhibited the expression of E6 and E7 proteins, resulting in p53 re-expression and hence triggering of p53 dependent apoptosis. This has been further supported by the recorded variations in the expression patterns of p21/WAF, pRb and E2F regulatory proteins. In case of mitochondrial apoptotic markers, the expression of Bax was restored and Bcl-2 level got decreased at 12th h. Cleaved caspases 3  9 and PARP were also observed after 3?√å√ôh of treatment. Interestingly, the epigenetic regulatory enzymes (DNMTs) were inhibited by idaein chloride. Thus, idaein chloride could be a potent source for developing a drug against cervical carcinoma.Anti-septic effects of pelargonidin on HMGB1-induced responses in vitro and in vivo. A certain nucleosomal protein-high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1)-has recently been established as a late mediator of sepsis, with a relatively wide therapeutic window for pharmacological intervention. Pelargonidin (PEL) is a well-known red pigment found in plants it has important biological activities that are potentially beneficial for human health. In the present study, we investigated whether PEL can modulate HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in mice. The anti-inflammatory activities of PEL were determined by measuring permeability, leukocyte adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in HMGB1-activated HUVECs and mice, as well as the beneficial effects of PEL on survival rate in the mouse sepsis model. The data showed that PEL had effectively inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of HMGB1 and suppressed HMGB1-mediated septic responses, such as hyperpermeability, adhesion and migration of leukocytes, and expression of cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, PEL inhibited the HMGB1-mediated production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), as well as the activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Collectively, these results indicate that PEL could be used to treat various severe vascular inflammatory diseases via the inhibition of the HMGB1 signaling pathwayTriterpene glycosides and other polar constituents of shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) kernels and their bioactivities. The MeOH extract of defatted shea (Vitellaria paradoxa Sapotaceae) kernels was investigated for its constituents, and fifteen oleanane-type triterpene acids and glycosides, two steroid glucosides, two pentane-2,4-diol glucosides, seven phenolic compounds, and three sugars, were isolated. The structures of five triterpene glycosides were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical methods. Upon evaluation of the bioactivity of the isolated compounds, it was found that some or most of the compounds have potent or moderate inhibitory activities against the following: melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells induced by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) generation of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, against Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12-O-teradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells t TPA-induced inflammation in mice, and proliferation of one or more of HL-60, A549, AZ521, and SK-BR-3 human cancer cell lines, respectively. Western blot analysis established that paradoxoside E inhibits melanogenesis by regulation of expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, and tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) and TRP-2. In addition, tieghemelin A was demonstrated to exhibit cytotoxic activity against A549 cells (IC50 13.5 ??M) mainly due to induction of apoptosis by flow cytometry. The extract of defatted shea kernels and its constituents may be, therefore, valuable as potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, skin-whitening, chemopreventive, and anticancer agents.Purification and characterization of a novel antitumor protein with antioxidant and deoxyribonuclease activity from edible mushroom Pholiota nameko. A novel antitumor protein from the edible mushroom Pholiota nameko (PNAP) was purified through a two-step chromatographic procedure including SP cation exchange chromatogram and Superdex gel filtration. The approximate molecular weight was demonstrated to be 18.5?√å√ôkDa by SDS-PAGE and ultracentrifugation analysis and N-terminal sequence was detected as AGRTFIGYNG by Edman degradation. Biochemical characterization showed that it exhibited significant antioxidant activity by effectively scavenging hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals compared to standard antioxidant butylated hydroxy anisole. PNAP had deoxyribonuclease activity with the optimum pH and temperature were 5.0 and 60?√å√ô??C respectively, as well as it can act on both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, but preferentially on double-stranded DNA. PNAP displayed antitumor activity against cancer cell lines such as MCF7 and Hela cells. Human breast cancer MCF7 cells treated with PNAP produced typical apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation, accumulation of sub-G1 cells and alternation of mitochondrial permeability. The PNAP induced apoptosis of MCF7 cells entailed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in release of cytochrome c into cytosol, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which are responsible for the execution of apoptosis, implying intrinsic signal pathway is involved in PNAP induced apoptosis.Antioxidant and anticancer activity of extract from Betula platyphylla var. japonica. The antioxidant and anticancer properties of a medicinal plant, Betula platyphylla var. japonica were investigated. The total methanol extract of B. platyphylla var. japonica had protective effects against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79-4) cell line and induced apoptotic cell death in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, a cancer cell line. B. platyphylla var. japonica extract significantly increased cell viability against H2O2. The extract also showed high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (IC50 2.4 microg/ml) and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (IC50 below 4.0 microg/ml). Furthermore, B. platyphylla var. japonica extract reduced the number of V79-4 cells arrested in G2/M in response to H2O2 treatment and increased the activities of several cellular antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Treatment with B. platyphylla var. japonica extract induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HL-60 cells, as shown by nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, increases in the subdiploid cell population, and fluorescence microscopy. B. platyphylla var. japonica extract gradually increased the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and led to the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. These findings suggest that B. platyphylla var. japonica exhibits potential antioxidant and anticancer properties.Carvacrol Induces Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-mediated Apoptosis Along with Cell Cycle Arrest at G0/G1 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells. Carvacrol, a major monoterpenoid phenol from Origanum and Thymus species, has been shown to exhibit antiproliferative and anticancer properties in a few recent studies. Nevertheless, detailed mechanism of the action of this compound in prostate cancer has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, in the current study, we examined the anticancer activity and mechanism of the action of carvacrol against human prostate cancer cells. It was found that the treatment of DU145 cells with carvacrol decreased cell viability in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The antiproliferative action of carvacrol leads to induction of apoptosis as confirmed by nuclear condensation, Annexin V-FITC/PI positive cells, and caspase-3 activation. In addition, carvacrol augmented reactive oxygen species generation and disruption in the mitochondrial membrane potential which has not been reported in the previous studies of carvacrol with prostate cancer. Moreover, carvacrol-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells was also accompanied by significant amount of growth arrest at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle which has also not been documented previously. To sum up, this study has established that carvacrol could be a promising chemotherapeutic agent and could have a direct practical implication and translational relevance to prostate cancer patients as Origanum consumption may retard prostate cancer progression.Effect of alkylaminophenols on growth inhibition and apoptosis of bone cancer cells. In this work, we report the anticancer properties of a series of 11 chemically synthesized alkylaminophenols against human osteosarcoma U2OS tumor cell line. Several assays including cytotoxicity, inhibitor kinetic study, cell migration, Annexin-V/PI double staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase 3/7 assays were conducted on this cell line. Cytotoxic 2-((3,4-dihydroquinolin-1(2H)-yl)(p-tolyl)methyl)phenol was determined to have an IC50 value of 36.6M against U2OS cells and it also inhibits the cell growth in time-dependent manner. The potent activity of lead compound against the growth of multiple cell lines, U2OS, MG-65 and HEK-293T, confirms the osteosarcoma cell specific inhibition. Further studies indicated that such compound is an inhibitor of metastatic property of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis agent. The ability of increasing ROS and inducing caspases 3 and 7 further confirm the contribution of programmed cell death in U2OS and HEK-293T cells. Additionally, four compounds based on the 2-(indolin-1-yl(aryl)methyl)-4-nitrophenol core were also identified to be cytotoxic with IC50 values in the 66-88 range. This work further demonstrates the anticancer properties of phenol derivatives, adding one more entry to the collection of promising chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment.Pleuropterus multiflorus (Hasuo) mediated straightforward eco-friendly synthesis of silver, gold nanoparticles and evaluation of their anti-cancer activity on A549 lung cancer cell line. Pleuropterus multiflorus (Hasuo) is a widely used medicinal plant in Korea and China for treating amnesia, isnomia, heart throbbing etc. With the constructive idea of promoting the wide-spread usage of P. multiflorus, we propose its indirect usage in the form of biologically active silver (Pm-AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (Pm-AuNPs). The synthesized nanoparticles were predominantly spherical, crystalline with the Z-average hydrodynamic diameter of 274.8nm and 104.8nm respectively. Also, proteins and phenols were identified as the major players involved in their synthesis and stability. Further, Pm-AgNPs at 25 were significantly cytotoxic to lung cancer cells, whereas, Pm-AuNPs were not cytotoxic to both normal keratinocyte and lung cancer cells even at 100. In addition, further evaluation of the anti-cancer activity of these new nanoparticles, such as migration and apoptosis, shown that Pm-AgNPs have a potential therapeutic effect on A549 lung cancer cell treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report dissecting out the ability of the endemic P. multiflorus for the synthesis of bioactive silver and gold nanoparticle which would open up doors for its extensive usage in medicinal field.Oleocanthal exerts antitumor effects on human liver and colon cancer cells through ROS generation. The beneficial health properties of the Mediter-ranean diet are well recognized. The principle source of fat in Mediterranean diet is extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). Oleocanthal (OC) is a naturally occurring minor phenolic compound isolated from EVOO, which has shown a potent anti-inflammatory activity, by means of its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. A large body of evidence indicates that phenols exhibit anticancer activities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential anticancer effects of OC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) models. A panel of human HCC (HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5) and CRC (HT29, SW480) cell lines was used. Cells were treated with OC, and cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated. Compared with classical commercially available COX inhibitors (ibuprofen, indomethacin, nimesulide), OC was more effective in inducing cell growth inhibition in HCC and CRC cells. Moreover, OC inhibited colony formation and induced apoptosis, as confirmed by PARP cleavage, activation of caspases 3/7 and chromatin condensation. OC treatment in a dose dependent-manner induced expression of gammaH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, increased intracellular ROS production and caused mitochondrial depolarization. Moreover, the effects of OC were suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Finally, OC was not toxic in primary normal human hepatocytes. In conclusion, OC treatment was found to exert a potent anticancer activity against HCC and CRC cells. Taken together, our findings provide preclinical support of the chemotherapeutic potential of EVOO against cancer.Hydroquinone analog 4-[(Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl) oxy]√å√ôphenol induces C26 colon cancer cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in√å√ôvivo. The 4[(Tetrahydro-pyran-yl) oxy] phenol (XG-d) hydroquinone analog, is found in Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. Although it is known for its antioxidant properties and high level of safety, its antitumor activity remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the anticancer effect of XG-d was determined in√å√ôvitro and in√å√ôvivo. The cytotoxicity of XG-d against C26 murine colon carcinoma cells was found to occur in a time and concentration-dependent manner, whereas little effect was observed in the two normal cell lines (HK-2 and L02) investigated. Oral administration of XG-d (100√å√ômg/kg) had effects on the tumor growth of tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, marked apoptosis was observed using Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometric analysis with annexin√å√ôpropidium iodide double staining. XG-d also downregulated the expression of B cell lymphoma√å√ô2 (Bcl-2), increased the expression levels of Bcl-2-associated √å√ôprotein and activated caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase. The present study demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that XG-d inhibited cancer cell growth via the induction of apoptosis and was also able to inhibit tumor growth in√å√ôvivo. These results demonstrated that XG-d may be used as a potential natural agent for cancer therapy with low toxicity.GRIM-mediated Stat3 activation is a determinant for resveratrol-induced proliferation and cytotoxicity in cervical tumor-derived cell lines. Resveratrol is a natural phenol, produced from red grapes, berries and peanuts. Previous studies have suggested that resveratrol exerts anticancer effects. Activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is important in cancer. However, the mechanisms by which resveratrol suppresses the Stat3 signaling pathway remain to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on GRIM-Stat3 signaling in HeLa cells, derived from a cervical tumor. HeLa cells were divided into experimental groups and treated with resveratrol. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression levels of Stat3, Stat3, GRIM and betaactin. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay. The results showed that 100  resveratrol suppressed the proliferation and Stat3 phosphorylation in HeLa cells, and induced the expression of the gene associated with retinoid-induced mortality 19 (GRIM19) protein. Overexpression of GRIM19 suppressed the Stat3 signaling pathway in HeLa cells. The Stat3 signaling pathway was activated following the downregulation of GRIM19 expression using short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Resveratrol suppressed cell proliferation, however, this effect was decreased through the use of siRNAs. The suppression of Stat3 phosphorylation by resveratrol decreased following treatment with siRNAs. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is among the first to identify GRIM19, Stat3 signaling as a target of resveratrol, and further elucidates the mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of resveratrol.Norcantharidin enhances ABT-737-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by transcriptional repression of Mcl-1. Small-molecule cell-permeable Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist ABT-737 has recently emerged as a novel cancer therapeutic agent because it potently induces apoptosis in certain cancer cells. However, since ABT-737 binds to Mcl-1 with low affinity, ABT-737-mediated apoptosis signaling is inhibited in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and other solid cancer cells due to the elevated expression of Mcl-1. Accordingly, strategies that target Mcl-1 are explored for overcoming ABT-737-resistance. In this study, we reported that Norcantharidin (NCTD), a small-molecule anticancer drug derived from Chinese traditional medicine blister beetle (Mylabris), induced transcriptional repression of Mcl-1 and considerably enhanced ABT-737-triggered cell viability inhibition and apoptosis in multiple HCC cell lines. Moreover, we observed that the enhancement of ABT-737-mediated apoptosis by NCTD was associated with activation of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway, which involved cytosolic release of cytochrome c, cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Additionally, knockdown of Bax/Bak, the key effectors permeabilizing mitochondrial outer membrane significantly attenuated the enhancement, indicating mitochondrial apoptosis pathway played an essential role in the execution of the apoptosis. Finally, knockdown of Mcl-1 substantially potentiated ABT-737-mediated apoptotic cell death, confirming the potency of Mcl-1 repression by NCTD in enhancing ABT-737-induced apoptosis. These results therefore suggest that combination treatment with NCTD can overcome ABT-737 resistance and enhance ABT-737 therapeutic efficacy in treating human HCC.Murraya koenigii leaf extract inhibits proteasome activity and induces cell death in breast cancer cells. Inhibition of the proteolytic activity of 26S proteasome, the protein-degrading machine, is now considered a novel and promising approach for cancer therapy. Interestingly, proteasome inhibitors have been demonstrated to selectively kill cancer cells and also enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, polyphenols/flavonoids have been reported to inhibit proteasome activity. Murraya koenigii Spreng, a medicinally important herb of Indian origin, has been used for centuries in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Here we show that Murraya koenigii leaves (curry leaves), a rich source of polyphenols, inhibit the proteolytic activity of the cancer cell proteasome, and cause cell death. Hydro-methanolic extract of curry leaves (CLE) was prepared and its total phenolic content [TPC] determined by, the Folin-Ciocalteau\\'s method. Two human breast carcinoma cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and a normal human lung fibroblast cell line, WI-38 were used for the studies. Cytotoxicity of the CLE was assessed by the MTT assay. We studied the effect of CLE on growth kinetics using colony formation assay. Growth arrest was assessed by cell cycle analysis and apoptosis by Annexin-V binding using flow cytometry. Inhibition of the endogenous 26S proteasome was studied in intact cells and cell extracts using substrates specific to 20S proteasomal enzymes. CLE decreased cell viability and altered the growth kinetics in both the breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. It showed a significant arrest of cells in the S phase albeit in cancer cells only. Annexin V binding data suggests that cell death was via the apoptotic pathway in both the cancer cell lines. CLE treatment significantly decreased the activity of the 26S proteasome in the cancer but not normal cells. Our study suggests M. koenigii leaves to be a potent source of proteasome inhibitors that lead to cancer cell death. Therefore, identification of active component(s) from the leaf extract could lead to the development of anti-cancer agents which could be useful in the treatment of different types of cancers.Resveratrol induces MMP-9 and cell migration via the p38 kinase and PI-3K pathways in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. Trans-3,4\\',5-trihydroxystilbene (resveratrol) is a grape polyphenol present in various plants, food products, red wine and grapes. Resveratrol has anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, anti-oxidant and anti-aging properties. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix,  and their expression may be regulated in cancer metastasis. In the present study,  we aimed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on MMPs and cell migration, and to understand the mechanism of action in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. We found that resveratrol inhibited HT1080 cell viability at various concentrations as detected by the MTT assay and FACS analysis. However, resveratrol dramatically increased the activation and expression of MMP-9 in a dose-and time-dependent  manner, as determined by gelatin zymography assay and western blot analysis. We also discovered that resveratrol enhanced the migratory ability of HT1080 cells,  as determined by the wound healing assay, and decreased the phosphorylation of  p38 kinase. Moreover, the Akt kinase was inhibited by resveratrol in the HT1080 cells. The inhibition of p38 and Akt kinases with SB203580 and LY294002 further increased resveratrol-induced MMP-9 as well as cell migration in the HT1080 cells. Our results suggest that resveratrol regulates MMP-9 and migratory abilities through the p38 kinase and PI-3K pathways in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells.Genistein, a soy phytoestrogen, prevents the growth of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells induced by 17beta-estradiol or bisphenol A via the inhibition of cell cycle progression. An endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) is a global health concern. In this study, we examined the effects of genistein (GEN) on bisphenol A (BPA) or 17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced cell growth and gene alterations of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). In an in vitro cell viability assay, E2 or BPA significantly increased the growth of BG-1 cells. This increased proliferative activity was reversed by treatment with ICI? 182,780, a well-known ER antagonist, while cell proliferation was further promoted in the presence of propyl pyrazole triol (PPT), an ERalpha agonist. These results imply that cell proliferation increased by E2 or BPA was mediated by ERs, particularly ERalpha. BPA clearly acted as a xenoestrogen in BG-1 ovarian cancer cells by mimicking E2 action. In contrast, GEN effectively suppressed BG-1 cell proliferation promoted by E2 or BPA by inhibiting cell cycle progression. E2 and BPA increased the expression of cyclin D1, a factor responsible for the G1/S cell cycle transition. They also decreased the expression of p21, a potent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that arrests the cell cycle in G1 phase, and promoted the proliferation of BG-1 cells. As shown by its repressive effect on cell growth, GEN decreased the expression of cyclin D1 augmented by E2 or BPA. On the other hand, GEN increased the p21 expression downregulated by E2 or BPA. Collectively, our findings suggest that GEN, a dietary phytoestrogen, has an inhibitory effect on the growth of estrogen-dependent cancers promoted by E2 or BPA.Apoptotic effects of protocatechuic acid in human breast, lung, liver, cervix, and prostate cancer cells: potential mechanisms of action. Apoptotic effects of protocatechuic acid (PCA) at 1, 2, 4, 8 micromol/L on human breast cancer MCF7 cell, lung cancer A549 cell, HepG2 cell, cervix HeLa cell, and prostate cancer LNCaP cell were examined. Results showed that PCA concentration-dependently decreased cell viability, increased lactate dehydrogenase leakage, enhanced DNA fragmentation, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and lowered Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity for these cancer cells (P < 0.05). PCA also concentration-dependently elevated caspase-3 activity in five cancer cells (P < 0.05), but this agent at 2-8 micromol/L significantly increased caspase-8 activity (P < 0.05). PCA concentration-dependently decreased intercellular adhesion molecule level in test cancer cells (P < 0.05) but significantly inhibited cell adhesion at 2-8 micromol/L (P < 0.05). PCA also concentration-dependently lowered the levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in five cancer cells (P < 0.05), but this agent at 2-8 micromol/L significantly suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor production (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that PCA is a potent anticancer agent to cause apoptosis or retard invasion and metastasis in these five cancer cells.Inhibition of Stat3 signaling pathway by nifuroxazide improves antitumor immunity and impairs colorectal carcinoma metastasis. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the one of the most common cancers with considerable metastatic potential, explaining the need for new drug candidates that inhibit tumor metastasis. The signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway has an important role in CRC and has been validated as a promising anticancer target for CRC therapy. In the present study, we report our findings on nifuroxazide, an antidiarrheal agent identified as an inhibitor of Stat3. Our studies showed that nifuroxazide decreased the viability of three CRC cell lines and induced apoptosis of cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, western blot analysis demonstrated that the occurrence of its apoptosis was correlated with the activation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2. In addition, nifuroxazide markedly impaired CRC cell migration and invasion by downregulating phosphorylated-Stat3Tyr705, and also impaired the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Furthermore, our studies showed that nifuroxazide also significantly inhibited the tumor metastasis in lung and abdomen metastasis models of colon cancer. Meanwhile, nifuroxazide functionally reduced the proliferation index, induced tumor apoptosis and impaired metastasis. Notably, nifuroxazide reduced the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the blood, spleens and tumors, accompanied by the increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumors. Importantly, a marked decrease in the number of M2-type macrophages in tumor in the abdomen metastasis model was also observed. Taken together, our results indicated that nifuroxazide could effectively inhibit tumor metastasis by mediating Stat3 pathway and it might have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of CRC.Biological activities of phenolic compounds and triterpenoids from the galls of Terminalia chebula. Nine phenolic compounds, including two phenolic carboxylic acids, 1 and 2, seven hydrolyzable tannins, 3-9, eight triterpenoids, including four oleanane-type triterpene acids, 10-13, and four of their glucosides, 14-17, isolated from a MeOH extract of the gall of Terminalia chebula Retz. (myrobalan tree Combretaceae), were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells induced by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), against the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, and against TPA-induced inflammation in mice. Their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activities and cytotoxic activities against four human cancer cell lines were also evaluated. Compounds 6-9 and 12 exhibited potent inhibitory activities against melanogenesis (39.3-66.3% melanin content) with low toxicity to the cells (74.5-105.9% cell viability) at a concentration of 10 ??M. Western-blot analysis revealed that isoterchebulin (8) reduced the protein levels of MITF (=microphtalmia-associated transcription factor), tyrosinase, and TRP-1 (=tyrosine-related protein 1), mostly in a concentration-dependent manner. Eight triterpenoids, 10-17, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction with the IC50 values in the range of 269-363 mol ratio/32 pmol TPA, while these compounds exhibited no DPPH scavenging activities (IC50 >100 ??M). On the other hand, the nine phenolic compounds, 1-9, exhibited potent radical-scavenging activities (IC50 1.4-10.9 ??M) with weak inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction (IC50 460-518 mol ratio/32 pmol TPA). The tannin 6 and seven triterpenoids, 10-16, have been shown to inhibit TPA-induced inflammation (1) in mice with the ID50 values in the range of 0.06-0.33. Arjungenin (10) exhibited inhibitory effect on skin-tumor promotion in an in vivo two-stage mouse-skin carcinogenesis test based on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) as initiator and with TPA as promoter. Compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-9, 12, and 13, against HL60 cell line, compounds 1 and 4, against AZ521 cell line, and compounds 1, 11, and 12, against SK-BR-3 cell line, showed moderate cytotoxic activitiesHispidulin mediates apoptosis in human renal cell carcinoma by inducing ceramide accumulation. Hispidulin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant S involucrata, exhibits anti-tumor effects in a wide array of human cancer cells, mainly through growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest. However, its precise anticancer mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that contribute to hispidulin-induced apoptosis of human clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) lines Caki-2 and ACHN. Hispidulin (10, 20 ??mol/L) decreased the viability of ccRCC cells in dose- and time-dependent manners without affecting that of normal tubular epithelial cells. Moreover, hispidulin treatment dose-dependently increased the levels of cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-9, but the inhibitors of caspase-8 and caspase-9 only partly abrogated hispidulin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that hispidulin triggered apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Moreover, hispidulin treatment significantly inhibited the activity of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and consequently promoted ceramide accumulation, thus leading to apoptosis of the cancer cells, whereas pretreatment with K6PC-5, an activator of SphK1, or overexpression of SphK1 significantly attenuated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of hispidulin. In addition, hispidulin treatment dose-dependently activated ROS/JNK signaling and led to cell apoptosis. We further demonstrated in Caki-2 xenograft nude mice that injection of hispidulin (20, 40 mg?√å√õkg-1?√å√õd-1, ip) dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth accompanied by decreased SphK1 activity and increased ceramide accumulation in tumor tissues. Our findings reveal a new explanation for the anti-tumor mechanisms of hispidulin, and suggest that SphK1 and ceramide may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ccRCCIn vitro effects and the related molecular mechanism of galangin and quercetin on human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901). Natural flavonoids are proven to be powerful against various cancers, but few studies have investigated the potential effects of two flavonoids galangin and quercetin on a human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901). In vitro growth inhibition and apoptosis of the two flavonoids on the SGC-7901 cells as well as potential mechanism about apoptosis induction are reported in the present study. The assaying results showed that the two flavonoids at 40-200 mmol/L for 24-72 hours conferred lower cell viability of 14.1-90.3% in dose- and time-dependent manner, and at 160 for 24-48 hours enhanced the proportion of apoptotic cells into 13.3-27.4% and 40.6-65.6%, respectively. Galangin was more powerful than quercetin to inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis and decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Oligonucleotide micro array, real-time RT-PCR and Western-blot analyses revealed expression changes of the genes and proteins in the treated cells, clarifying a mechanism related to apoptosis induction. The two flavonoids activated caspase-8, which cleaved Bid into tBid simultaneously, Bax transferred from cytosol into mitochondria to decrease MMP consequentially, cytochrome c released from mitochondria activated caspase-9, and then caspase-9 activated caspase-3, which executed the apoptosis. That is, the apoptosis occurred via a mitochondrial pathway involving caspase-8/Bid/Bax activation.Curcumin inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis in HT-29 cell lines through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism. Curcumin, a natural pigment extracted from Curcuma longa, has anti-carcinogenic activities in many cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by curcumin are still unknown. In the current study, we investigated the roles of reactive oxygen species in curcumin stimulated apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Curcumin significantly reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis, activated caspase-3 activity and stimulated concentration-dependent release of ROS. Inhibition of ROS generation by scavengers suppressed apoptosis and Bcl-2 expression induced by curcumin, indicating the critical roles of ROS in the apoptotic process. However, caspase-3 inhibitor (z-VAD-FMK) couldn\\'t completely inhibit the curcumin induced apoptosis, indicating ROS mediated apoptosis may be caspase-independent. Together, our findings showed that ROS played significant roles in the apoptosis induced by curcumin in HT-29 cellsCurcumin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis in human papillary thyroid carcinoma BCPAP cells via disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine tumor. Our previous studies have demonstrated that curcumin can induce apoptosis in human papillary thyroid carcinoma BCPAP cells. However, the underlined mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major organelle for synthesis, maturation, and folding proteins as well as a large store for Ca. Overcoming chronically activated ER stress by triggering pro-apoptotic pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is a novel strategy for cancer therapeutics. Our study aimed to uncover the ER stress pathway involved in the apoptosis caused by curcumin. BCPAP cells were treated with different doses of curcumin (12.5-50√å√ì√å√†√å¬¨??M). Annexin V/PI double staining was used to determine cell apoptosis. Rhod-2/AM calcium fluorescence probe assay was performed to measure the calcium level of endoplasmic reticulum. Western blot was used to examine the expression of ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein 10 (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). X-box binding protein1 (XBP-1) spliced form was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Curcumin significantly inhibited anchorage-independent cell growth and induced apoptosis in BCPAP cells. Curcumin induced ER stress and UPR responses in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) partially reversed the antigrowth activity of curcumin. Moreover, curcumin significantly increased inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) phosphorylation and XBP-1 mRNA splicing to induce a subsets of ER chaperones. Increased cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), which enhances expression of its downstream target CHOP was also observed. Furthermore, curcumin induced intracellular Ca influx through inhibition of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase 2A (SERCA2) pump. The increased cytosolic Ca then bound to calmodulin to activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling, leading to mitochondrial apoptosis pathway activation. Ca chelator BAPTA partially reversed curcumin-induced ER stress and growth suppression, confirming the possible involvement of calcium homeostasis disruption in this response. Curcumin inhibits thyroid cancer cell growth, at least partially, through ER stress-associated apoptosis. Our observations provoked that ER stress activation may be a promising therapeutic target for thyroid cancer treatment.Curcuminoids combined with gefitinib mediated apoptosis and autophagy of human oral cancer SAS cells in vitro and reduced tumor of SAS cell xenograft mice in vivo. Gefitinib has been used for cancer patients and curcumin (CUR), demethoxycurcumin (DMC), or bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) also shown to induce cancer cell apoptosis. However, no report shows the combination of gefitinib with, CUR, DMC, or BDMC induce cell apoptosis and autophagy in human oral cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of gefitinib with or without CUR, DMC, or BDMC co-treatment on the cell viability, apoptotic cell death, autophagy, mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), and caspase-3 activities by flow cytometry assay and autophagy by acridine orange (AO) staining in human oral cancer SAS cells. Results indicated that gefitinib co-treated with CUR, DMC, or BDMC decreased total viable cell number through the induction of cell apoptosis and autophagy and decreased the levels of MMP and increased caspase-3 activities in SAS cells. Western blotting indicated that gefitinib combined with CUR, DMC, or BDMC led to decrease Bcl-2 protein expression which is an antiapoptotic protein and to increase ATG5, Beclin 1, p62/SQSTM1, and LC3 expression that associated with cell autophagy in SAS cells. Gefitinib combined with CUR and DMC led to significantly reduce the tumor weights and volumes in SAS cell xenograft nude mice but did not affect the total body weights. Based on those observations, we suggest that the combination of gefitinib with CUR, DMC, and BDMC can be a potential anticancer agent for human oral cancer in future.Curcumin enhances the anti-cancer effects of Paris Saponin II in lung cancer cells. To investigate the synergistic mechanisms of Paris Saponin II (PSII) and Curcumin (CUR) in lung cancer. The combination changed the cellular uptake of CUR and PSII, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and cytokine levels were analysed on different lung cancer cells. The combination displayed a synergistic anti-cancer effect through promoting the cellular uptake of CUR on different lung cancer cells. Hoechst H33258 staining and FACS assay indicated that the combination of PSII and CUR induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blot and cytokine antibody microarray suggested that the combination activated death receptors such as DR6, CD40/CD40L, FasL and TNF-alpha to induce cancer cells apoptosis, and up-regulated IGFBP-1 leading to inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway and increase of p21 and p27, which therefore induced a G2 phase arrest in NCI-H446 cells. Meanwhile, the combination suppressed PCNA and NF-kB pathway in 4 kinds of lung cancer cells. They activated the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, and inhibited PI3K in NCI-H460 and NCI-H446 cells, enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK in NCI-H1299 cells, and increased the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, and suppressed PI3K in NCI-H520 cells. PSII combined with CUR had a synergistic anti-cancer effect on lung cancer cells. These findings provided a rationale for using the combination of curcumin and PSII in the treatment of lung cancer in future.Curcumin suppresses proliferation and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer by modulation of MTA1-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Curcumin, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, has a diversity of antitumor activities. It has been previously demonstrated that curcumin can inhibit the invasion and metastasis of tumors through activation of the tumor suppressor DnaJ-like heat shock protein 40 (HLJ1). However, the specific roles and mechanisms of curcumin in regulating the malignant behaviors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells still remain unclear. In this study, we found that curcumin could inhibit the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells and induce G0/G1 phase arrest. Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) overexpression has been detected in a wide variety of aggressive tumors and plays an important role on cell invasion and metastasis. Our results showed that curcumin could effectively inhibit the MTA1 expression of NSCLC cells. Further research on the subsequent mechanism showed that curcumin inhibited the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells through MTA1-mediated inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was reported to play a critical cooperative role on promoting lung tumorigenesis. Thus, these investigations provided novel insights into the mechanisms of curcumin on inhibition of NSCLC cell growth and invasion and showed potential therapeutic strategies for NSCLC.Curcumin inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic mouse model of human pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm originating from transformed cells arising in tissues forming the pancreas. The best chemotherapeutic agent used to treat pancreatic cancer is the gemcitabine. However, gemcitabine treatment is associated with many side effects. Thus novel strategies involving less toxic agents for treatment of pancreatic cancer are necessary. Curcumin is one such agent that inhibits the proliferation and angiogenesis of a wide variety of tumor cells, through the modulation of many cell signalling pathways. In this study, we investigated whether curcumin plays antitumor effects in MIA PaCa-2 cells. In vitro studies showed that curcumin inhibits the proliferation and enhances apoptosis of MIA PaCa-2 cells. To test whether the antitumor activity of curcumin is also observed in vivo, we generated an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer by injection of MIA PaCa-2 cells in nude mice. We placed mice on diet containing curcumin at 0.6% for 6 weeks. In these treated mice tumors were smaller with respect to controls and showed a downregulation of the transcription nuclear factor NF-kB and NF-kB-regulated gene products. Overall, our data indicate that curcumin has a great potential in treatment of human pancreatic cancer through the modulation of NF-kB pathway.Cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activities of leaf extract of Croton bonplandianus Baill. against lung cancer cell line A549. The acetone extract (AcE) of the Croton bonplandianus Baill., an exotic weed of the Euphorbiaceae family was studied for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest in A549 cell line and antioxidant capacities using MTT assay, acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB staining), cell cycle analysis and DPPH radical scavenging assay respectively. Based on the cytotoxic activity, the extract was tested for the apoptotic effect using AO/EB and Hoechst 33258 staining. The apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Further, to determine the stage of cell death, cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry and AcE was found to arrest G2/M phase in a dose dependent manner. The number of cells in G2/M phase increases with concurrent accumulation of cells in sub G√å√ì√å¬©√å√†/G√å√ì√å¬©\\\\u0081phase indicates the induction of apoptosis at G2M phase. The free radical scavenging activity of the AcE against DPPH was considerably significant. The cytotoxic, apoptotic and antioxidant effect of the AcE could be well correlated with the presence of potent free radical scavenging secondary metabolites such as phenols (43 ? 0.05 g/mL), flavonoids (3.5 ? 0.07 √å\\x81g/mL) and tannin (0.36 ? 0.1 √å\\x81g/mL). Our study has shown that A549 cells were more sensitive to AcE with an I of 15.68 ? 0.006 √å\\x81g/mL compared to the standard drug 2.20 ? 0.008 g/mL (cisplatin). The results suggest that Croton bonplandianus could serve as a potential source of alternative therapeutic agent for treating cancer. Further research is required to isolate the active principle compound and determination of its anticancer property.Antitumor activity of the novel flavonoid Oncamex in preclinical breast cancer models. The natural polyphenol myricetin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in preclinical cancer models. We hypothesised that myricetin-derived flavonoids with enhanced redox properties, improved cell uptake and mitochondrial targeting might have increased potential as antitumor agents. We studied the effect of a second-generation flavonoid analogue Oncamex in a panel of seven breast cancer cell lines, applying western blotting, gene expression analysis, fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry of xenograft tissue to investigate its mechanism of action. Proliferation assays showed that Oncamex treatment for 8√å√ì√å√†√å√áh reduced cell viability and induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, concomitant with increased caspase activation. Microarray analysis showed that Oncamex was associated with changes in the expression of genes controlling cell cycle and apoptosis. Fluorescence microscopy showed the compound\\'s mitochondrial targeting and reactive oxygen species-modulating properties, inducing superoxide production at concentrations associated with antiproliferative effects. A preliminary in vivo study in mice implanted with the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft showed that Oncamex inhibited tumor growth, reducing tissue viability and Ki-67 proliferation, with no signs of untoward effects on the animals. Oncamex is a novel flavonoid capable of specific mitochondrial delivery and redox modulation. It has shown antitumor activity in preclinical models of breast cancer, supporting the potential of this prototypic candidate for its continued development as an anticancer agent.Inhibition of breast cancer cell survival by Xanthohumol via modulation of the Notch signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. Natural compounds derived from plants have been an important source of numerous clinically useful anticancer agents. Nevertheless, limited studies indicate that xanthohumol (XN), a major prenylated flavonoid in hop plants (Humulus lupulus), may possess anticarcinogenic properties. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the antitumorigenic effects and the underlying mechanism of XN on breast cancer in vivo and in vitro. A 4T1 breast tumor mouse model was used in the present study to investigate XN suppression of tumor growth as detected by tumorigenicity assays in vivo. In addition, in vitro studies revealed that XN significantly decreased cell viability, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as confirmed by an MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis, indicating anticarcinogenic activity of XN against breast cancer. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the inactivation of the Notch signaling pathway, Notch 1 and Ki-67, in vivo consistently, XN caused decreased activation of the Notch signaling pathway and apoptotic regulators B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-extra large and caspase 3, as determined by western blot analysis in vitro. This study suggests that XN may potentially be useful as a chemopreventive agent during breast hyperplasia and carcinogenesis, acting via the regulation of Notch associated apoptotic regulators in vivo and in vitro.Phloretin induces apoptosis in H-Ras MCF10A human breast tumor cells through the activation of p53 via JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Mutations in Ras play a critical role in the development of human cancers, including breast cancer. We investigated the possible antiproliferative effects of the naturally occurring dihydrochalcone phloretin [2\\',4\\',6\\'-trihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propiophenone] on H-Ras-transformed MCF10A human breast epithelial (H-Ras MCF10A) cells. Phloretin suppressed H-Ras MCF10A cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and induced nuclear condensation in the cells, indicating that phloretin-induced cell death occurs mainly via the induction of apoptosis. Prominent upregulation of p53 and Bax and cleavage of poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase were also detected in the phloretin-treated cells. Finally, phloretin markedly increased caspase-3 activity as well as JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Our findings suggest that the phloretin-induced apoptosis of breast tumor cells contributes to the chemopreventive potential of phloretin against breast cancer.Coumarin-chalcone hybrid instigates DNA damage by minor groove binding and stabilizes p53 through post translational modifications. S009-131, a coumarin-chalcone hybrid, had been shown to possess anti-proliferative and anti-tumor effect by triggering apoptosis. In this report, we investigated role of DNA damage signalling pathway in S009-131 induced cancer cell death. Here we show that S009-131 causes DNA damage by potential binding to the minor groove which led to the phosphorylation and activation of ATM and DNA-PK, but not ATR, at earlier time points in order to initiate repair process. S009-131 induced DNA damage response triggered activation of p53 through phosphorylation at its key residues. Pharmacological inhibition of PIKKs abrogated S009-131 induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 15. DNA damage induced phosphorylation resulted in reduced proteasomal degradation of p53 by disrupting p53-MDM2 interaction. Additionally, our docking studies revealed that S009-131 might also contribute to increased cellular p53 level by occupying p53 binding pocket of MDM2. Posttranslational modifications of p53 upon S009-131 treatment led to enhanced affinity of p53 towards responsive elements (p53-RE) in the promoter regions of target genes and increased transcriptional efficiency. Together, the results suggest that S009-131 cleaves DNA through minor groove binding and eventually activates PIKKs associated DNA damage response signalling to promote stabilization and enhanced transcriptional activity of p53 through posttranslational modifications at key residues.Dihydroartemisinin inhibits endothelial cell proliferation through the suppression of the ERK signaling pathway. Disrupting tumor angiogenesis serves as an important strategy for cancer therapy. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, has exhibited potent anti-angiogenic activity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully understood. The present study aimed to investigate the role of DHA on endothelial cell proliferation, the essential process in angiogenesis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with DHA were examined for proliferation, apoptosis and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Proliferation of HUVECs was inhibited by 20 √•¬µM DHA without induction of apoptosis. DHA also reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of ERK1/2 in HUVECs. In addition, DHA suppressed the transcription and protein expression of ERK1/2 downstream effectors c-Fos and c-Myc. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing real-time analysis demonstrated that ERK signaling inhibitor PD98059 comprises the anti-proliferative effects of DHA. Thus, DHA inhibits endothelial cell proliferation by suppressing the ERK signaling pathway. The present study strengthened the potential of DHA as an angiogenesis inhibitor for cancer treatment.Three dimensional staging of breast cancer. Breast cancers are three dimensional solids but very few are spherical. We hypothesized that calculations based on the greatest diameter would not accurately reflect tumor volume, that three dimensional measurements would affect tumor staging. 165 invasive carcinomas measuring 2.5 cm or less, having three measured diameters (a > or = b > or = c) noted were evaluated. Tumor volume was calculated using four geometric models: the spherical 4 3 pi (a 2)3, prolate spheroid 4 3 pi (a 2) (c 2)2, oblate spheroid 4 3 pi (a 2)2 (b 2),, ellipsoid 4 3 pi (a 2 x b 2 x c 2). The ellipsoid correctly determined the volume for any tumor shape. All cases were stratified according to the TNM staging system. Differences in mean volume calculated as a sphere, ellipsoid for each tumor subclass were analyzed using Student\\'s T test. The reclassification of tumors by the ellipsoid formula was determined. Seventy-six (46.1%) had tumors with three different diameters while only six (3.6%) were true spheres having three identical diameters. Mean tumor volume analysis of T1a, T1b, T1c,, T2 tumors demonstrated a statistically significant overestimation of volume when utilizing the sphere formula instead of the ellipsoid formula (p < 0.05). The differences in volume were more dramatic as the diameters increased. A total of 41 tumors were moved into smaller T subclasses including 10 node positive patients. Tumor volume analysis demonstrates that use of only the greatest diameter poorly reflects the true volume of a lesion, consistently overestimates volume. The ellipsoid formula accurately calculates volume for these three dimensional tumors, when utilized has significant relevance to staging small invasive breast cancers.Relative risk of malignant tumors in analgesic abusers. Effects of long-term intake of aspirin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) e.g. aspirin, indomethacin are reported in epidemiological, experimental studies to reduce the risk for colo-rectal cancer, potentially other malignant tumors. We examined the effect of NSAIDs on tumor prevalence in abusers of mixed analgesics containing aspirin, phenacetine, caffeine or codein. 618 analgesic abusers who were autopsied between 1968-1983 were compared with a control group without evidence of analgesic abuse matched for sex, age, year autopsy was performed. Abusers were found to have an overall risk of 0.40 fold of having developed a malignancy as compared with the controls. Excluding patients with urinary tract tumors which are increased in analgesic abusers the risk was further decreased to 0.28. No statistically significant effect was found for patients with prostate cancer. The results encourage prospective control studies in high risk patients.Total intravenous anesthesia for two patients complicated with myotonic dystrophy. Total intravenous anesthesia with propofol, fentanyl, ketamine (PFK) was given to two patients complicated with myotonic dystrophy. Case-1: A 42-year-old female underwent a hemithyroidectomy. Anesthesia was induced slowly with intravenous ketamine 20 mg, propofol 60 mg. Her tracheal intubation was performed smoothly without any muscle relaxants. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion of 5 mg.kg-1.h-1, ketamine infusion of 0.3 mg.kg-1.h-1, fentanyl 200 micrograms in total. She regained consciousness 20 minutes after the end of propofol infusion,, 15 minutes later, her trachea was extubated without any troubles. Case-2: A 41-year-old female underwent a removal of left parotid tumor. Anesthesia was induced slowly with ketamine 40 mg, propofol 100 mg intravenously. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion of 5-10 mg.kg-1.h-1, ketamine infusion of 0.5 mg.kg-1.h-1, fentanyl 350 micrograms in total. No muscle relaxant was used through the surgical procedure. Emergence from anesthesia was observed 10 minutes after the end of propofol infusion, her trachea was extubated. When a nasogastric tube was pulled out, her respiration stopped suddenly, she was intubated again only for two hours without any troubles. In both cases their serum CPK levels, rectal temperatures were very stable. PFK method would be a choice for patients with myotonic dystrophy.Development, disappearance of tolerance to induction of interferon, tnf response in athletes treated with natural immunostimulant. The effect of nonspecific immunostimulation was examined in 15 basketball players subjected to extensive physical effort. The To√å√â\\x89√õ?pa* Torf Preparation (TTP*), a natural immunostimulating drug, was applied orally, one 5 mg tablet daily, in two 21-day cycles, separated by 2-week hiatus. Blood samples were collected 4 times, after each of two TTP* cycles, after the first, second hiatus. Whole blood assay was used to determine the spontaneous, induced production of interferon (IFN), tnf (TNF). The levels of the cytokines were measured by microbioassays. TTP* stimulated synthesis of IFN, TNF in the whole blood cultures. However, after the oral administraton of TTP* for 3 weeks the leukocytes of the athletes developed hyporeactivity to IFN induction by TTP*, to a lesser extent to another superinducer--a mixture of phytohemagglutinin, bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The hyporeactivity state disappeared spontaneously within 2 weeks. In contrast, the tolerance to TNF induction did not develop during the TTP* administration. The increase of immunoglobulins, mainly of IgM, IgG classes, an acute phase protein--alpha1-antitrypsin, was observed at the late phase of the treatment. We suggest that the cytokine levels may be early markers for immunoprophylaxis. Furthermore, high production of IFN, TNF may be associated with extensive physical effort.Redox cycling of phenol induces oxidative stress in epidermal keratinocytes. A variety of phenolic compounds are utilized for industrial production of phenol-formaldehyde resins, paints, lacquers, cosmetics,, pharmaceuticals. Skin exposure to industrial phenolics is known to cause skin rash, dermal inflammation, contact dermatitis, leucoderma,, cancer promotion. The biochemical mechanisms of cytotoxicity of phenolic compounds are not well understood. We hypothesized that enzymatic one-electron oxidation of phenolic compounds resulting in the generation of phenoxyl radicals may be an important contributor to the cytotoxic effects. Phenoxyl radicals are readily reduced by thiols, ascorbate,, other intracellular reductants (e.g., NADH, NADPH) regenerating the parent phenolic compound. Hence, phenolic compounds may undergo enzymatically driven redox-cycling thus causing oxidative stress. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed endogenous thiols, lipid peroxidation,, total antioxidant reserves in normal human keratinocytes exposed to phenol. Using a newly developed cis-parinaric acid-based procedure to assay site-specific oxidative stress in membrane phospholipids, we found that phenol at subtoxic concentrations (50 microM) caused oxidation of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine (but not of phosphatidylserine) in keratinocytes.  Incubation of ascorbate-preloaded keratinocytes with phenol produced an electron paramagnetic resonance-detectable signal of ascorbate radicals, suggesting that redox-cycling of one-electron oxidation products of phenol, its phenoxyl radicals, is involved in the oxidative effects. As no cytotoxicity was observed in keratinocytes exposed to 50 microM or 500 microM phenol, we conclude that phenol at subtoxic concentrations causes significant oxidative stress.How is the liver primed or sensitized for alcoholic liver disease? This article represents the proceedings of a symposium at the 2000 ISBRA Meeting in Yokohama, Japan. The chairs were. The presentations were Dysregulated TNF signaling in alcoholic liver disease.

Due to some severe side effects classical hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is currently being challenged by a therapy with phytoestrogens. Particularly soy, red clover derived isoflavones are advertised as selective esr1 modulators (SERMs) with only desired, no undesired estrogenic effects. Evidence that this is the case however is scarce. Most studies investigating climacteric complaints did not find beneficial effects. A proposed beneficial effect on mammary cancer is unproven. The majority of studies indicate that a putative beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system are questionable due to the fact that estradiol which--like isoflavones--increase HDL, decrease LDL concentrations appear not to prevent arteriosclerosis in the human. In the urogenital tract, including the vagina, soy, red clover derived isoflavones are without effects. Prostate cancer, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: systematic review, meta-analysis. Animal, laboratory studies suggest that regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce prostate cancer risk. To assess this association, we conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis of observational studies published before January 2003. We derived summary odds_ratio (ORs) using both fixed, random effects models, performed subgroup analyses to explore the possible sources of heterogeneity between combined studies. We identified 12 reports (five retrospective, seven prospective studies). Most studies of aspirin use reported inverse associations, but only two were statistically significant. The summary OR for the association between aspirin use, prostate cancer was 0.9 (95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.99 test of homogeneity P=0.32),, varied from 1.0 for retrospective studies to 0.85 for prospective studies. Studies that measured exposure to a mixture of NSAIDs were less consistent. The current epidemiological evidence and, in particular, the strong, consistent laboratory evidence underline the need for additional epidemiological studies to confirm the direction, magnitude of the association.Red clover isoflavones in practice: a clinician\\'s view. The subject of phytoestrogen use must be seen against the background of increasing controversy surrounding the role of hormone replacement therapy. Phytoestrogens such as those derived from red clover may help with hot flushes, which are a common menopausal complaint. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend its use for bone protection in a group of women who are at high risk.Anesthetic management with propofol during pheochromocytoma resection under bispectral index monitoring. In three patients undergoing pheochromocytoma resection under propofol fentanyl anesthesia, bispectral index (BIS) was monitored for assessment of hypnotic effect. In two patients, arterial blood concentrations of propofol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),, compared with those of the estimated blood concentrations. Until resection of the tumor, propofol was infused at a rate of 10 mg x kg x hr. After resection of the tumor, propofol dosage was reduced to 3-6 mg x kg x hr, keeping the BIS values around 60. Rapid infusion of fluid, norepinephrine was required to maintain blood pressure after removal of the tumor in two patients. In one patient, blood pressure was maintained well without rapid infusion of fluid or vasopressor. Arterial blood concentration of propofol after resection of the tumor was equal to the estimated blood concentration (3.04 vs 3.02 microg x ml) in a patient without rapid infusion of fluid. In a patient with rapid infusion of fluid, the arterial blood concentration was lower than the estimated blood concentration (2.59 vs 3.58 microg x ml). The anesthetic depth can not be estimated accurately by hemodynamic changes in the patients undergoing pheochromocytoma resection. BIS monitoring should be recommended for adjustment of propofol dosage after pheochromocytoma resection.Atherosclerosis is a long-term chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased concentrations of inflammatory hepatic markers, such as CRP and fibrinogen, and of peripheral origin, such as. Effective coronary artery disease (CAD) prevention requires the use of agents that act beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering. appear to comprehensively address some of the most common clinical phenotypes of the high CAD risk patient of the 21st century such as in the syndrome and type 2 diabetes: low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high triglycerides, small, dense low-density lipoprotein, and a proinflammatory, procoagulant state.General versus spinal anesthesia with different forms of sedation in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy: results of a prospective, randomized study. To assess the impact of spinal anesthesia (SpA) combined with three different forms of conscious sedation on intraoperative, postoperative outcome in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for organ confined prostate cancer (pCa). A total of 121 consecutive patients with pCa undergoing RRP were randomized into four groups. They were randomized as follows: group 1 (general anesthesia: 34 patients), group 2 (lumbar 2 to lumbar 3 interspace SpA with diazepam as sedative agent: 28), group 3 (SpA with propofol: 30),, group 4 (SpA with midazolam: 29). Intraoperative, perioperative parameters were collected. The present study showed that muscle relaxation throughout RRP was not different in the four groups bleeding was significantly (P = 0.04) lower with SpA, regardless of the form of sedation. Group 3 patients reported the best postoperative oxygen saturation percentage by pulse oximetry, sedation score (P = 0.02 d.f. = 3, P < 0.0001 d.f. = 3, respectively), the shortest waiting time in the postoperative holding area (P < 0.001 d.f. = 3), the lowest pain on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.0004 d.f. = 3),, the highest frequency of first flatus passage (P = 0.0001 d.f. = 3). A higher number of group 4 patients were able to carry out unassisted ambulation (P < 0.0001 d.f. = 3). Conscious sedation coupled with SpA is a safe, reliable, effective procedure for patients undergoing RRP. The use of propofol as sedative agent offers several advantages both over other types of conscious sedation, general anesthesia.The consumption of fruits, vegetables,, whole grains rich in antioxidative phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer\\'s disease, cataract,, aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the world thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC),, phenolic acid compositions of typical, mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2,, high-amylose) were investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in methanol extracts, 60.41-67.26% in HCl methanol (1 99, v v) extracts of corn. The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g, from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic acid equiv kg of corn in methanol, HCl methanol extracts, respectively. The TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv kg of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80, 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv kg of corn in methanol, HCl methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 10.57-12.47, 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv kg of corn in methanol, HCl methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv kg of corn. The composition of phenolic acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 mg kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg kg), syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg kg), ferulic acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg kg),, o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg kg). Levels of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL,, ORAC in HCl methanol extracts were obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high temperatures (65, 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL,, ORAC values when compared to methanol, HCl methanol extracts. High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) corn genotypes.Routine aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the primary prevention of colorectal cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement. This statement summarizes the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation, supporting scientific evidence on routine use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The complete information on which this statement is based, including evidence tables, references, is available in the accompanying articles in this issue, on the USPSTF Web site (http: www.preventiveservices.ahrq.gov). The USPSTF is redesigning its recommendation statement in response to feedback from primary care clinicians. The USPSTF plans to release, later in 2007, a new, updated recommendation statement that is easier to read, incorporates advances in USPSTF methodology. The recommendation statement below is an interim version that combines existing language, elements with a new format. Although the definitions of grades remain the same, other elements have been revised.Secondary chemoprevention of Barrett\\'s esophagus with celecoxib: results of a randomized trial. Barrett\\'s esophagus is a premalignant condition that is a risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a disease whose incidence is rapidly increasing. Because aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as celecoxib, may decrease the risk of developing esophageal cancer, we investigated the effect of long-term administration of celecoxib in patients with Barrett\\'s esophagus with dysplasia. Chemoprevention for Barrett\\'s Esophagus Trial (CBET) is a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett\\'s esophagus, low- or high-grade dysplasia. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo, both administered orally twice daily,, then stratified by grade of dysplasia. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 48 weeks of treatment in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia between the celecoxib, placebo arms. Secondary, tertiary outcomes included evaluation of changes in histology, expression levels of relevant biomarkers. All statistical tests were two-sided. From April 1, 2000, through June 30, 2003, 222 patients were registered into CBET,, 100 of them with low- or high-grade Barrett\\'s dysplasia were randomly assigned to treatment (49 to celecoxib, 51 to placebo). After 48 weeks of treatment, no difference was observed in the median change in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia or cancer between treatment groups in either the low-grade (median change with celecoxib = -0.09, interquartile range IQR = -0.32 to 0.14, with placebo = -0.07, IQR = -0.26 to 0.12 P = .64) or high-grade (median change with celecoxib = 0.12, IQR = -0.31 to 0.55,, with placebo = 0.02, IQR = -0.24 to 0.28 P = .88) stratum. No statistically significant differences in total surface area of the Barrett\\'s esophagus in prostaglandin levels. Administration of 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily for 48 weeks of treatment does not appear to prevent progression of Barrett\\'s dysplasia to cancer.Mechanism of proteoglycan aggregate degradation in cartilage stimulated with oncostatin M. To investigate the potential synergistic, differential effects of cytokine combinations on proteoglycan aggregate catabolism in cartilage. Bovine articular cartilage explants were maintained in organ culture, subjected to stimulation with cytokine combinations. Aggrecan, link protein, hyaluronan (HA) release, degradation were analyzed,, the effect of the hyaluronidase inhibitor apigenin was investigated. For all cytokine mixtures studied cleavage of aggrecan only by aggrecanase action was apparent. This was abolished by the hyaluronidase inhibitor, apigenin. In addition, in the presence of OSM a low molecular weight aggrecan G3 product was observed. Under cytokine stimulation, aggrecan release from cartilage may take place via proteolysis of the aggrecan core protein or via depolymerization of HA, with the latter being induced by OSM. OSM is associated with joint inflammation, its participation may account for the more rapid loss of aggrecan from articular cartilage in the inflammatory arthritides, compared to osteoarthritis.Colorectal cancer risk, chronic illnesses, operations, medications: case control results from the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. 1988. The associations between colorectal cancer risk, several chronic illnesses, operations, various medications were examined in 715 colorectal cancer cases, 727 age-, sex-matched controls in data derived from a large, comprehensive population-based study of this cancer conducted in Melbourne, Australia. There was a statistically significant deficit among cases of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, chronic chest disease, chronic arthritis, a statistically significant excess of \\'haemorrhoids\\' among cases,, all of these differences were consistent for both colon cancer , rectal cancers, for both males, females. Although no statistically significant differences were found for other cancers, there were twice as many breast cancers among cases (16) than among controls (8), also there were 9 uterine cancers among cases, only 2 among controls. There was a statistically significant deficit among cases in the use of aspirin-containing medication, vitamin supplements, this was consistent for both colon cancer , rectal cancers, for both males, females. There was a statistically significant excess of large bowel polypectomy among cases. The modelling of these significant associations simultaneously in a logistic regression equation indicated that hypertension, heart disease, chronic arthritis, aspirin use were each independent effects, consistent for both colon cancer , rectal cancers for both males, females, also that these effects were independent of dietary risk factors previously described in the Melbourne study. Lung cancer, regular use of aspirin, nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US. There is evidence of a reduced risk of some cancer sites associated with use of aspirin (ASA), nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NANSAIDs). Our objective was to examine the association of regular use of ASA, NANSAIDs with lung cancer. A hospital-based case-control study of 1884 incident cases of lung cancer, 6251 controls with noncancer diagnoses. Use of ASA, NANSAIDs was considered \\'regular\\' if it occurred on > or =4 days week, lasted for > or =3 months. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds_ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals. The OR for regular use of ASA was 1.1 (0.9-1.4),, the corresponding estimate for regular NANSAID use was 1.0 (0.7-1.3). There was no evidence of decreased risk within strata of age, sex, years of education, or interview year. Examining the association within strata of duration of use, recency of use, cigarette smoking status, pack-years of cigarette smoking, or histologic type of cancer produced no ORs significantly different from 1.0. The hypothesis that regular use of ASA or NANSAIDs reduces the risk of lung cancer is not supported by the present data.Patient preferences for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. Although evidence suggests that aspirin, celecoxib may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), these drugs can also cause harmful side effects. The aim of this study was to characterize patient preferences for celecoxib, aspirin. Participants completed a computer-based patient decision-making questionnaire that included an educational component outlining the benefits, harms of celecoxib, aspirin. Under the base conditions 7.4% would take celecoxib, 43.6% would take aspirin males were more willing than females to take aspirin. Patients identified the increased risk of myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal events as the primary reasons for their unwillingness to take celecoxib, aspirin, respectively. A majority of subjects would not take either drug, after considering their benefits, harms, although participants were almost six times more likely to take aspirin than celecoxib. These data serve to inform physicians, researchers regarding the variability, factors that affect patient preferences for CRC chemoprevention.Do Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) Increase the Risk of Thyroid Cancer? An increased incidence of thyroid cancer has been reported in many parts of the world including the United States during the past several decades. Recently emerging evidence has demonstrated that polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs), particularly polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), alter thyroid hormone homeostasis, cause thyroid dysfunction. However, few studies have been conducted to test whether exposure to PBDEs, other PHAHs increases the risk of thyroid cancer. Here, we hypothesize that elevated exposure to PHAHs, particularly PBDEs, increases the risk of thyroid cancer, may explain part of the increase in incidence of thyroid cancer during the past several decades. Such variation may result in different individual susceptibilities to PBDEs, other PHAHs, the subsequent development of thyroid cancer. The investigation of this hypothesis will lead to an improved understanding of the role of PBDEs, other PHAHs in thyroid tumorigenesis, may provide a real means to prevent this deadly disease.Monitoring, reducing exposure of infants to pollutants in house dust. The health risks to babies from pollutants in house dust may be 100 times greater than for adults. The young ingest more dust, are up to ten times more vulnerable to such exposures. House dust is the main exposure source for infants to allergens, lead,, PBDEs, as well as a major source of exposure to pesticides, PAHs, Gram-negative bacteria, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, phthalates, phenols,, other EDCs, mutagens,, carcinogens. Median or upper percentile concentrations in house dust of lead, several pesticides, PAHs may exceed health-based standards in North America. Early contact with pollutants among the very young is associated with higher rates of chronic illness such as asthma, loss of intelligence, ADHD,, cancer in children, adults. The potential of infants, who live in areas with soil contaminated by automotive, industrial emissions, can be given more protection by improved home cleaning, hand washing. Babies who live in houses built before 1978 have a prospective need for protection against lead exposures homes built before 1940 have even higher lead exposure risks. The concentration of pollutants in house dust may be 2-32 times higher than that found in the soil near a house. Reducing infant exposures, at this critical time in their development, may reduce lifetime health costs, improve early learning,, increase adult productivity. Some interventions show a very rapid payback. Two large studies provide evidence that home visits to reduce the exposure of children with poorly controlled asthma triggers may return more than 100% on investment in 1 yr in reduced health costs. The tools provided to families during home visits, designed to reduce dust exposures, included vacuum cleaners with dirt finders, HEPA filtration, allergy control bedding covers, high-quality door mats,, HEPA air filters. Infants receive their highest exposure to pollutants in dust at home, where they spend the most time,, where the family has the most mitigation control. Normal vacuum cleaning allows deep dust to build up in carpets where it can be brought to the surface, become airborne as a result of activity on the carpet. Vacuums with dirt finders allow families to use the three-spot test to monitor deep dust, which can reinforce good cleaning habits. Motivated families that receive home visits from trained outreach workers can monitor, reduce dust exposures by 90% or more in 1 wk. The cost of such visits is low considering the reduction of risks achieved. Improved home cleaning is one of the first results observed among families who receive home visits from MHEs, CHWs. We believe that proven intervention methods can reduce the exposure of infants to pollutants in house dust, while recognizing that much remains to be learned about improving the effectiveness of such methods.Effects of propofol induction on haemodynamics. Propofol is probably the most popular intravenous anaesthetic in daily practice. Its use is known to be associated with dose-dependent cardiovascular compromise. We have assessed the effect of a single dose of propofol on cardiovascular function. Eighty-six ASA I, II patients of both sexes, scheduled for elective thoracic cancer surgery, were enrolled to the study. Midazolam 7.5 mg was given as premedication. All patients received epidural or paravertebral catheters one day before the surgery,, a Swan-Ganz catheter before induction. MAP, CO, SVI, PAP, PCWP, SVRI, PVRI, LVSWI, RWSWI, CPP were measured before induction (I), after administration of 1 mg kg propofol with 1-3 microg kg fentanyl, during spontaneous respiration (II). Propofol increased: heart rate (8%), PAP (12%), PVRI (27%), PCWP (27%), decreased MAP (4.5%), CI (12%), SVI (18%), LVSWI (23%), RVSWI (17%). CPP decreased by 7%. SVRI remained unchanged. The results indicated that 1 mg kg propofol moderately compromised cardiac contractility, increased afterload on the right ventricle, without significant effect on coronary perfusion pressure. The cardiovascular compromise was clinically insignificant, but caution is required when propofol is administered in larger doses.Acute postischemic treatment with esr1 agonist or esr1-beta agonist improves myocardial recovery. After ischemia reperfusion (I R) injury, female hearts demonstrate improved functional recovery compared with male, which suggests a protective role for estrogen. Acute postischemic treatment with 17-beta-estradiol (E2) attenuates myocardial dysfunction. However, it is unknown by which esr1 (ER) E2 mediates this acute cardioprotection during I R. Therefore, we hypothesize that postischemic infusion of the selective ER-alpha agonist (4,4\\',4\\'\\'- 4-propyl-(1H pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl tris-phenol PPT ) or the selective ER-beta agonist (2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl propionitrile DPN ) will improve myocardial function after I R injury. Isolated, perfused hearts (Langendorff) from adult male rats were subjected to 25 minutes of ischemia followed by 40 minutes of reperfusion. Hearts (n = 4-6 per group) were randomly infused with either perfusate, PPT or DPN at 1, 10, or 100 nmol L throughout reperfusion. After I R, heart tissue was analyzed for tnf (TNF alpha, interleukin (IL 1beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Postischemic treatment with 10 nmol L of PPT significantly improved myocardial function. Additionally, 10 or 100 nmol L of DPN significantly increased myocardial functional recovery after I R injury, with maximum benefit at the 10 nmol L dose. A trend toward lower levels of LDH was noted in DPN-, PPT-treated groups after I R injury. Neither PPT nor DPN affected myocardial production of TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. However, higher levels of myocardial VEGF were noted in the PPT-treated group compared with controls. Both ER-alpha, ER-beta are involved in mediating E2-induced rapid cardioprotection after I R injury. ER subtypes may benefit both males, females in response to myocardial ischemia.Mass balance for POPs in hazardous, municipal solid waste incinerators. The amount of different persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the input of waste incinerators was compared to that in the output. Three cases were considered: a rotary kiln incinerating hazardous waste, a grate furnace incinerating municipal solid waste (MSW), the same grate furnace co-incinerating plastics of waste of electrical, electronic equipment (WEEE), automotive shredder residue (ASR) with MSW. The mass balance for PCBs in the rotary kiln indicates that these POPs are destroyed effectively during incineration. The grate furnace can be a sink or source of PCDD Fs, PCBs depending on the concentrations in the incinerated waste. In order to compare the total amount of POPs in input, output, a methodology was developed whereby the amount of POPs was weighed according to minimal risk doses (MRDs) or cancer potency factors. For both incinerators the PCDD Fs, PCBs, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the main contributors to total weighed POP output. In MSW, the PCDD Fs, PBDD Fs, polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) are the main contributors to the weighed POP input. The ratios of the weighed POP-input over -output clearly indicate that the rotary kiln incinerating hazardous waste is a weighed POP sink. The grate furnace incinerating MSW is a weighed POP sink or source depending on the POP-concentrations in the waste, but the difference between output, input is rather limited. When e.g. ASR, plastics of WEEE, containing high concentrations of PBDEs, PCBs, are co-incinerated in the grate furnace, it is clearly a weighed POP sink. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be protective against cardiac complications following anthracycline chemotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX), despite causing cardiac toxicity, is an anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent that plays an important role in the treatment of breast cancer. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) may protect against cardiac toxicity in patients receiving DOX chemotherapy. A total of 143 patients receiving DOX at the Masonic Comprehensive Cancer Clinic, University of Minnesota, who had two or more multigated blood pool imaging (MUGA) scans or echocardiograms performed between 2004, 2007 were identified, reviewed. Patients with a 10% absolute drop in their ejection fraction (EF) or more to below 55% were identified, compared with those that did not have a 10% decline in EF. Impact of patient variables, the use of concurrent medications on EF drop were evaluated using logistic regression. Median age was 52 years old. 85 (60%) were female. Cancer diagnosis was breast (n = 26), lymphoma (n = 92),, other (n = 25). In spite of a similar baseline EF in all the patients, 22 142 (15%) patients had a significant drop in EF during DOX chemotherapy. Adjusting for age, the odds_ratio of EF drop associated with the use of ACE-I is 0.267 (P = 0.0940), suggesting that ACE-I has a protective effect. Cumulative DOX dose, the use of beta-blockers, or aspirin did not appear to be predictive or protective. Although not statistically significant, this study suggests that the use of ACE-I when given with DOX chemotherapy protects against DOX chemotherapy, warrants further investigation.Increased risk of colon cancer associated with a genetic polymorphism of SMAD7. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified SMAD7 on 8q21 as being associated with colorectal cancer. We evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the SMAD7 gene, including rs4939827, rs12953717,, rs4464148, previously identified from GWAS in a large population-based case-control study of colon cancer. We observed that rs12953717 was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of colon cancer odds_ratio, 1.38 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.13-1.68 P linear trend < 0.01 for the TT genotype compared with the CC genotype, whereas the CC genotype of the rs4939827 SNP was inversely associated with colon cancer (0.77 95% CI, 0.64-0.93) relative to the TT genotype. There were no significant differences in association for either of these polymorphisms when stratified by age, tumor site, sex, or family history. The odds_ratio between SMAD7, colon cancer among individuals reporting recent aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.43-0.85) for the CC genotype of the rs4939827 polymorphism, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.20-2.38) for the TT genotype of the rs1295371 polymorphism. This result compares to odds_ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68-1.09) for rs4939827, 1.22 (95% CI, 0.96-1.56) among individuals who did not use aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. No significant associations were observed for the rs4464148 SNP or other SNPs evaluated in the SMAD7. These results corroborate the findings of GWAS in colon cancer pointing to SMAD7, reinforce interest in SNPs in this gene.The relationship of cerb B 2 expression with esr1, progesterone receptor, prognostic parameters in endometrial carcinomas. Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of ER, PR, c-erbB-2 were performed in 72 EC cases. We detected a positive staining with c erbB 2 in 18.1% of the cases, determined a statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2, PR. We could not find a statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2 staining, ER. There was not a statistically significant difference between c-erbB-2, histological grade. The highest level of c-erbB-2 was found in grade 2 cases. There was not any statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2, menstrual status, myometrial invasion, lymph node status, stage, survival. Although our study provides additional evidence of the potential prognostic role of c-erbB-2, further prospective, controlled studies are required to validate their clinical usefulness.Effects of electroacupuncture of different acupoint groups on sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing resection of supratentorial tumors. To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) of different acupoint groups on the sevoflurane anesthetic requirement for resection of supratentorial tumors, the speed of post-operation recovery. A total of 120 cases of supratentorial tumor resection patients were randomly, equally allocated into general anesthesia (GA) group, EA-proximal acupoints group (EA-PA group), EA-distant acupoints group (EA-DA group). The supratentorial tumor patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane for surgery. Proximal acupoints used were Fengchi (GB 20), Tianzhu (BL 10), Cuanzhu (BL 2), Yuyao (EX-HN 4) that the formesr2 acupoints, the lattesr2 acupoints were for penetrative needling, distant acupoints used were Hegu (LI 4), Waiguan (TE 5), Jinmen (BL 63), Taichong (LR 3), Zusanli (ST 36), Qiuxu (GB 40) on the craniotomy side,, stimulated with EA (2 Hz 100 Hz, a tolerable electric stimulating strength), beginning from the anesthesia induction till the end of surgical operation. All patients were anesthetized by inhalation of propofol (2 mg kg), sufentanil (0.3 microg kg), vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg kg), maintained with sevoflurane. The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), bispectral index (BIS),, the speed of recovery were recorded. In comparison with the GA group, the end-tidal concentrations during anesthesia maintenance at the time-points of post skull drilling, dura incising, intracranial operation in EA-PA group, the time-points of post skull drilling, skull opening, dura incising,, intracranial operation in EA-DA group,, the MAC of sevoflurane at the time-points of skull drilling in EA-DA group,, skull opening, dura incising, intracranial operation, dura suturing in both EA-PA, EA-DA groups were significantly lower (P 0.05). EA of both proximal, distant acupoints can reduce the expired concentration, MAC of sevoflurane during anesthesia maintenance,, accelerate the recovery after cease of anesthesia in supratentorial tumor resection patients.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, risk of melanoma. We investigated the association between NSAIDs, melanoma to determine if there was epidemiologic evidence of a chemopreventive effect from these medications. Three hundred twenty-seven subjects with incident melanoma, 119√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°melanoma-free controls completed a structured interview assessing melanoma risk factors. The unadjusted odds_ratio (OR) for use of nonaspirin NSAIDs was 0.58 (95% CI 0.31-1.11), in a comparison of subjects with melanoma to controls. After adjustment for melanoma risk factors, the OR was 0.71 (95% CI 0.23-2.02). Aspirin users had an unadjusted OR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.45-1.69), an adjusted OR of 1.45 (95% CI 0.44-4.74). In this pilot study, we found no evidence of a significant association between analgesic use, melanoma risk when potential confounders are assessed. Based on conflicting reports in the literature, meta-analysis may be appropriate.Subchronic oral toxicity, cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies of resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol with cancer preventive activity. To characterize the subchronic oral toxicity of resveratrol, CD rats received daily gavage doses of 0, 200, 400, or 1000 mg resveratrol kg day,, beagle dogs received daily capsule doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg resveratrol kg day for 90 days. Resveratrol induced only minimal toxicity, consisting of dose-related reductions in body weight gain in female rats, both sexes of dogs,, a statistically significant increase in bilirubin levels in rats at the 1000 mg kg day dose. Clinical observations, hematology, ophthalmology, neurotoxicity evaluations (functional observational batteries), organ weights,, gross pathology provided no biologically significant evidence of resveratrol toxicity in either species. In rats, the high dose of resveratrol reduced the incidence of cardiomyopathy no other microscopic changes were seen. Histopathologic changes in dogs were limited to minimal inflammatory infiltrates in the kidney, urinary bladder, which were not considered toxicologically significant. A cardiovascular safety pharmacology (telemetry) study in dogs revealed no evidence of resveratrol toxicity. Based on body weight effects, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for resveratrol was 200mg kg day in rats, 600 mg kg day in dogs. The apparent cardioprotective activity of resveratrol in rats demonstrates that its potentially beneficial activities may extend beyond efficacy in cancer prevention.Evaluation of phytochemical composition, antioxidant capacity of a decoction containing Adenanthera pavonina L., Thespesia populnea L. A decoction prepared with barks of Adenanthera pavonina, Thespesia populnea is a herbal formulation which has been prescribed in Sri Lanka in the treatment of cancer patients for many years. This study was designed to investigate its phytochemical, antioxidant properties. The total phenolics, flavonoids were determined using Folin-Ciocalteau, aluminum chloride colorimetric methods, respectively. Gallic acid content in the decoction was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The antioxidant properties were evaluated by 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical assay, nitric oxide scavenging assay, deoxyribose method,, the reducing power of the decoction. The concentration of total phenols, flavonoids,, gallic acid of the decoction were  gallic acid equivalents,  of (- Epigallocatechin gallate equivalents,,  respectively. The EC50 for DPPH, nitric oxide scavenging,, deoxyribose assays were, respectively. Reducing power of the decoction increased with the concentration. These suggested that the decoction prepared with A. pavonina, T. populnea can be a nutraceuticals.Non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the primary chemoprevention of non-gastrointestinal cancer: summary of evidence. There is evidence that aspirin is effective for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. Due to their similar pharmacodynamics, the use of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been suggested for other cancer sites. Although this possibility has been discussed in the literature, uncertainty remains about the actual effects of NSAIDs other than aspirin in nongastrointestinal cancer. To summarize the best available evidence of the primary chemopreventive effects of non-aspirin NSAIDs for nongastrointestinal cancer. Our inclusion criteria were narrative or systematic reviews, clinical guidelines and, if they had not been previously included, primary controlled studies that evaluated the effectiveness of non-aspirin NSAIDs in preventing non-gastrointestinal cancer in healthy individuals. Studies were retrieved from the following databases: Guidelines.gov, BMJ Clinical Evidence, TRIP database, UpToDate, MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, Scopus. Two independent reviewers selected eligible studies. Data were extracted by one reviewer, crosschecked by two others. We found 9,984 non-duplicated articles, included 56 eligible studies. Most of these studies were observational. The studies reported conflicting results or no statistically significant associations between the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs, risk of lung, ovary, bladder, prostate, skin,, head, neck cancers. In contrast, an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma found to be statistically significant. The included studies had methodological limitations, which reduces our confidence in their results. We did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of the non-aspirin NSAIDs for the primary chemoprevention of a wide variety of non-gastrointestinal cancers. This scenario suggests caution when considering the routine use of non-aspirin NSAIDs. Additional well-conducted controlled studies may provide more conclusive evidence on this issue, but there are concerns about the risks of such exposure.Histogram analysis of whole-lesion enhancement in differentiating clear cell from papillary subtype of renal cell cancer. To compare histogram analysis of voxel-based whole-lesion (WL) enhancement to qualitative assessment, region-of-interest (ROI based enhancement analysis in discriminating the renal cell cancer (RCC) subtype clear cell RCC (ccRCC) from papillary RCC (pRCC). In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, 73 patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging prior to surgery for RCC between January 2007, January 2010. Three-dimensional fat-suppressed T1-weighted gradient-echo corticomedullary phase acquisitions, obtained before, after contrast agent administration, were transferred to a workstation at which automated registration followed by semiautomated segmentation of the RCC was performed. Percent enhancement was computed on a per-voxel basis: (SI(post) - SI(pre)) SI(pre) .100, where SI(pre), SI(post) indicate signal intensity before, after contrast enhancement, respectively. The WL quantitative parameters of mean, median,, third quartile enhancement, histogram distribution parameters kurtosis, skewness were computed for each lesion. WL enhancement parameters were compared with ROI-based analysis, qualitative assessment with regards to diagnostic accuracy, interreader agreement in differentiating ccRCC from pRCC. There were 19 pRCCs, 55 ccRCCs at pathologic examination. ccRCC had significantly higher WL mean, median,, third quartile enhancement compared with pRCC, hade significantly lower kurtosis, skewness (all P < .001). Third quartile enhancement had the highest accuracy (94.6% area under the curve, 0.980) in discriminating ccRCC from pRCC, which was significantly higher than the accuracy of qualitative assessment (86.0% P = .04) but not significantly higher than that of ROI enhancement (89.2% P = .52). WL enhancement parameters had higher interreader agreement (k = 0.91-1.0) compared with ROI enhancement or qualitative assessment (k = 0.83, 0.7, respectively) in discriminating ccRCC from pRCC. WL enhancement histogram analysis is feasible, can potentially be used to differentiate ccRCC from pRCC tapentadol ER for managing moderate to severe chronic pain. Chronic non-cancer-related pain affects a large proportion of the adult population, is often difficult to manage effectively. Although opioid analgesics have been used to relieve chronic pain of different etiologies, opioids are associated with a range of side effects that may reduce patient quality of life, lead to reduced compliance with treatment.Tapentadol is a centrally acting analgesic with 2 mechanisms of action, √å?√•?-opioid receptor agonism, norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, that is available in an extended-release formulation for the management of chronic pain. To review the efficacy of tapentadol extended release (ER) for the management of moderate to severe chronic nociceptive, neuropathic pain. Efficacy results are summarized for four 15-week phase 3 studies of tapentadol ER in patients with moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis knee pain (2 studies ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00421928, NCT00486811), low back pain (NCT00449176),, pain related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN NCT00455520) a one-year phase 3 study of tapentadol ER in patients with moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis pain or low back pain (NCT00361504), a pooled analysis of data from the 15-week studies in patients with osteoarthritis knee pain or low back pain. A summary of the comparative tolerability for tapentadol ER, the active comparator used in these studies, oxycodone controlled release (CR), is provided. of these studies showed that tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) was effective for the management of moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis knee pain, low back pain,, pain related to DPN. Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) has been shown to provide comparable pain relief to oxycodone HCl CR (20 - 50 mg bid) for chronic osteoarthritis knee pain, low back pain over up to one year of treatment. Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) was associated with an improved tolerability profile, particularly gastrointestinal tolerability profile,, with lower rates of treatment discontinuations, adverse event-related discontinuations compared with oxycodone HCl CR (50 - 250 mg bid) over up to one year of treatment in patients with osteoarthritis knee pain, low back pain. Differences in the design, duration of these phase 3 studies may limit comparisons of the efficacy results nevertheless, this demonstrates the broad of tapentadol ER for different types of nociceptive, neuropathic pain. Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) is moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain, low back pain,, pain related to DPN, provides efficacy similar to that of oxycodone HCl CR (20 - 50 mg bid) for patients with osteoarthritis, low back pain. Tapentadol ER treatment has been associated with better gastrointestinal tolerability, compliance with therapy than oxycodone CR, which suggests that tapentadol ER may be a better option for the long-term management of chronic pain.The effect of fibrin clot inhibitors on the immunomodulatory efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Gu√å√Ñ√•¬©rin therapy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. To determine if there is a difference in clinical outcomes among non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients taking fibrin clot-inhibiting (FCI) medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin) while receiving Bacillus Calmette-Gu√å√Ñ√•¬©rin (BCG) therapy compared with their counterparts not taking anticoagulation. Our Investigational Review Board-approved database was queried for patients who received an induction course of BCG from 2001 to 2011. The analysis included 224 patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), cystectomy-free survival, overall survival,, disease-specific survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method stratified by FCI status. Logistic regression was used to predict the initial response rate to BCG, progression by FCI status. Of the 224 patients analyzed, 68, 19,, 23 patients were taking aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, respectively, at BCG induction. No specific FCI was associated with differences in cystectomy-free survival, overall survival, disease-specific survival, or the likelihood of progression at recurrence. Neither warfarin nor clopidogrel affected RFS. Patients taking aspirin trended toward increased RFS, although this was not statistically significant (P√å√¢ = .058). Contrary to the postulated inhibitory molecular effect of FCI on BCG-binding activity, this study did not substantiate a significant impact on BCG efficacy of the concomitant use of these medications during BCG induction. The observation that aspirin use potentiates an increased initial response to√å√¢ BCG may warrant further analysisHighly exfoliated sulfonated graphene sheets (SGSs), an alternative to graphene oxide, graphene derivatives, were synthesized, characterized. These particles were found to be non-toxic across the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 √å?√•?g ml. Internalization of SGSs was also studied by means of optical, electron microscopy. Although not conclusive, high-resolution transmission, scanning electron microscopy revealed variant internalization behaviors where some of the SGS became folded, compartmentalized into tight bundles within cellular organelles. The ability for cancer should be further investigated.Is aspirin useful in primary prevention? There is no evidence that aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, although it may change the way that they present. Indeed, there is no evidence that long-term aspirin should be given to patients even with known cardiovascular disease. Theoretical arguments that aspirin can prevent cardiovascular events by reducing the propagation of thrombus are countered by evidence that plaque haemorrhage from vasa vasorum may also cause plaque growth, instability. There is evidence that aspirin causes serious bleeding into the brain, the gut. Aspirin may also detract from the benefits of drugs that have definite cardiovascular benefits, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Meta-analysis is prone to multiple biases in favour of aspirin, including publication bias, bias due to trial, endpoint selection, bias due to interpretation. Meta-analysis should not be relied on in preference to adequately powered clinical trials. Unfortunately, the benefits of aspirin, if they exist, may be so small that a very large study indeed would be required to demonstrate that its benefits outweigh its risks. The evidence that aspirin might reduce cancer is intriguing but relies on data from trials conducted many decades ago using a wide range of aspirin doses. There is no reliable evidence that aspirin used in the current fashionable doses of 50-100 mg day is of any benefit in any common clinical setting.Despite the rise of public awareness, the incidence rate among the white population has been rising constantly for several decades. Systematic improvement in knowledge about the biology of pigment cells. Substances found in everyday diet, such as genistein, apigenin, quercetin, resveratrol,, curcumin may also have potential chemopreventive qualities. However, studies examining these compounds have shown widely varying results. Early reports on the possible chemopreventive activity of statins, fibrates were not proved by the results of randomized clinical trials. Similarly, case-control studies examining the influence of NSAIDs on the risk of melanoma do not confirm the antitumor activity. Further clinical trials involving carefully selected target populations as well as the identification of specific biomarkers of prognostic, predictive value seem to be essential for the evaluation studied substances.This review summarizes the weight of evidence relevant to the hypothesized mode of action (MOA) for PPAR? activator-induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis and identifies gaps in our knowledge of this MOA. Chemical-specific and mechanistic data support concordance of temporal and dose-response relationships for the key events associated with many PPAR? activators including a phthalate ester plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and the drug gemfibrozil. While biologically plausible in humans, the hypothesized key events in the rodent MOA, for PPAR? activators, are unlikely to induce liver tumors in humans because of toxicodynamic and biological differences in responses. This conclusion is based on minimal or no effects observed on growth pathways, hepatocellular proliferation and liver tumors in humans and/or species (including hamsters, guinea pigs and cynomolgous monkeys) that are more appropriate human surrogates than mice and rats at overlapping dose levels. Overall, the panel concluded that significant quantitative differences in PPAR? activator-induced effects related to liver cancer formation exist between rodents and humans. On the basis of these quantitative differences, most of the workgroup felt that the rodent MOA is \"not relevant to humans\" with the remaining members concluding that the MOA is \"unlikely to be relevant to humans\". The two groups differed in their level of confidence based on perceived limitations of the quantitative and mechanistic knowledge of the species differences, which for some panel members strongly supports but cannot preclude the absence of effects under unlikely exposure scenarios.Statin , aspirin for prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma: what are the levels of evidence? Recent analyses of large cohorts suggest that statins or aspirin may reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to their observational nature, these studies may have been flawed by confounding by indication or immortal time bias. Reviews of clinical trials conducted in the metabolic or cardiovascular domain showed no effect of statins on cancer of any type. More convincing evidence is needed to support the potential preventive effect of aspirin on HCC, but a clinical trial would be achievable in patients who are at high risk. Prostate cancer, the influence of dietary factors, supplements: a systematic review. Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer worldwide after lung cancer. There is increasing evidence that diet, lifestyle plays a crucial role in prostate cancer biology, tumorigenesis. Prostate cancer itself represents a good model of cancer in which to look for chemopreventive agents due to the high disease prevalence, slowly progressive nature,, long latency period. Dietary agents have gained considerable attention, often receiving much publicity in the media. To review the key evidence available for potential chemopreventive nutrients. The methodology for this review involved a PubMed search from 1990 to 2013 using the key-words diet, prostate cancer, nutrition, prostate cancer, dietary factors, prostate cancer, prostate cancer epidemiology, prostate cancer prevention, prostate cancer progression. Red meat, dietary fat, milk intake should be minimised as they appear to increase the risk of prostate cancer. Fruit, vegetables, polyphenols may be preventive in prostate cancer, but further studies are needed to draw more solid conclusions, to clarify their role in patients with an established diagnosis of prostate cancer. Selenium, vitamin supplements cannot be advocated for the prevention of prostate cancer, indeed higher doses may be associated with a worse prognosis. There is no specific evidence regarding benefits of probiotics or prebiotics in prostate cancer. From the wealth of evidence available, many recommendations can be made although more randomised control trials are required. These need to be carefully designed due to the many confounding factors, heterogeneity of the population.Separation of two major chalcones from Angelica keiskei by high-speed counter-current chromatography. Angelica keiskei (Shin-sun cho) is an edible higher plant with the beneficial preventive effects on cancer, hypertension,, coronary heart disease. Two bioactive chalcones of Shin-sun cho, xanthoangelol (1), 4-hydroxyderricin (2), were separated simultaneously by using high-speed counter-current chromatography with a two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane-EtOAc-MeOH-H2O (9:5:9:4). Only nonconsuming processes, solvent fractionations, Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, were conducted as presteps. Xanthoangelol (1, 35.9 mg, 99.9 % purity at 254, 365 nm), 4-hydroxyderricin (2, 4.4 mg, 98.7 % purity at 254 nm, 98.8 % purity at 365 nm) were successfully purified from 70 mg of the processed extract from A. keiskei. The structures of two compounds were confirmed by (1)H-, (13)C-NMR analysis. Effects of stellate ganglionic block on hemodynamic changes, intrapulmonary shunt in perioperative patients with esophageal cancer. The aim of this study√å√¢ was to observe the effects of stellate ganglion block (SGB) on hemodynamic changes, intrapulmonary shunt during one-lung ventilation (OLV). Thirty ASA class I-II patients undergoing elective esophageal surgery were randomly divided into two groups: general anesthesia group (group N, n=15), general anesthesia combined SGB group (group S, n=15), patients in group S were received left SGB before induction. Radial artery was cannulated for arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring, blood sampling, Swan-Ganz catheter was position in the pulmonary artery via right internal jugular vein under local anesthesia. ECG, MAP, HR, CVP, continuous cardiac output (CCO) index, BIS were continuously monitored during anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with propofol 1.5-2.0 mg kg, sufentanil 0.4 √å?√•?g kg,, Rocuronium 0.6-0.9 mg kg. Endobronchial occluder was placed blindly after tracheal indubation, the correct position was verified by auscultation, fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The patients were mechanically ventilated. The ventilation conditions were Fio2=100%, VT = 8-10 ml kg, I: E = 1:2, respiratory rate was adjusted to maintained PETCO2 at 35-45 mmHg during both two-lung ventilation (TLV), OLV. Anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of propofol 4-10 mg kg√å√¢√•√°h, sufentanil 0.2 √å?√•?g kg√å√¢√•√°h, vecuronium o.1 mg kg√å√¢√•√°h, BIS was maintained at 45-55. Blood samples were taken from radial artery, S-G catheter for blood gas analysis at following intervals: during spontaneous breathing when the patient was awake (T0), 1 min after tracheal indubation (T1), 1 min after patient was placed in lateral position (T2), 15 min after it (T3), 1 min after ribs was braced (T4), 30, 60, 120 min during the course of OLV (T5, T6, T7), the two lungs were ventilated again for 30 min (T8), Qs Qt was calculated. SVRI, MAP, HR in group N increased significantly at T1, T2, T4 compared with group S (p < 0.05). Qs Qt was significantly increased after patient was placed in lateral position, increased further during OLV the calculated Qs Qt values were highest at T5√å√¢√•√° PaO2 was significantly lower after OLV was started, reached the lowest level at T6 then was gradually increasing. There was no significant difference in Qs Qt, PaO2 at all time points between two groups. SGB before induction effectively suppress the stress response work as stable blood dynamics, does not affect Qs Qt, arterial oxygenation during OLV, SGB is a safe technique of anesthesia for general thoracic surgery.Mediterranean diet, dietary polyphenols, low grade inflammation: results from the MOLI-SANI study. Low grade inflammation is characterized by raised concentrations of inflammatory markers in the absence of any overt symptoms, is recognized as a risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies suggest that low grade inflammation is mitigated by health promoting behaviours such as healthy eating patterns, physical activity, body weight maintenance, tobacco cessation. To date, large scale studies were mainly focused on circulating markers, little evidence is available on cellular biomarkers. The MOLI-SANI study is a prospective cohort study that has recruited  men, women aged years from the general population of the Molise Region, a Southern Italian area, with the purpose of investigating genetic, environmental risk protection factors for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease, cancer. Within this cohort, a composite score of low grade inflammation based on the use of plasmatic (C-reactive protein), cellular (leukocyte, platelet counts, granulocyte lymphocyte ratio) biomarkers has been proposed, validated. This score accounts for all possible effects of such inflammatory markers, thus overcoming any potential bias linked to the multi-collinearity of these variables. Of notice, the MOLI-SANI study was the first to address the relationship between the traditional Mediterranean diet, platelet, leucocyte counts as emerging cellular biomarkers of low grade inflammation. The present review paper will discuss the main findings derived from the MOLI-SANI study on the association of low grade inflammation with a Mediterranean eating pattern, with a particular emphasis on the associated dietary polyphenols.Effect of statin, aspirin use on toxicity, pathological complete response rate of neo-adjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer. To retrospectively evaluate the potential impact of statin, aspirin use on acute toxicity, pathological complete response (pCR) rate in rectal cancer patients receiving neo-adjuvant long-course radiation therapy (LCRT) with concurrent chemotherapy. A retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing neo-adjuvant LCRT for rectal adenocarcinoma at the Regional Cancer Treatment Service between 1 Septembesr2007, 1 June 2011. Data obtained include demographic details date, radiological TNM stage at diagnosis medication taken at time of RT toxicity during LCRT, surgical histology to determine if a pCR was obtained following LCRT. Neo-adjuvant LCRT was administered to 142 patients for rectal cancer during this period concurrent chemotherapy was omitted in 13 due to significant comorbidities. TNM stage was 2 or 3 radiologically at diagnosis in 127 (89.4%) of patients. At the time of LCRT, 23% were taking a statin, 25% were taking aspirin. Of 135 assessable patients, 34 (13%) achieved a pCR at surgery. On logistic regression, pCR was not significantly associated with the use of chemotherapy, statins, aspirin, other NSAIDs, T-stage or N-stage. There was no significant correlation between statin or aspirin use with bladder or rectal toxicity. Actuarial time to maximum rectal toxicity was not different in statin users or nonusers. In contrast to other larger retrospective series, this study did not find improvements in toxicity or pCR rate through statin or aspirin use in rectal cancer patients undergoing LCRT. Their potential benefits in this setting would be best studied prospectively in a large randomized trial. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating neurodegenerative disease, representing a major cause of neurological disability in young adults. The present study may be the first to indicate a pro-remyelinative effect for resveratrol which might represent a potential additive benefit in treating Multiple sclerosis.pro-inflammatory cytokine production of senior horses in vitro. Senior horses exhibit increased chronic, low-grade inflammation systemically, termed inflamm-aging. Inflammation is associated with many afflictions common to the horse, including laminitis, osteoarthritis, which are commonly treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) flunixin meglumine, phenylbutazone. long-term treatment with NSAIDs can result in negative side effects. Thus, bioactive polyphenols including curcuminoids, resveratrol, quercetin, pterostilbene,, hydroxypterostilbene were investigated. Heparinized blood was collected via jugular venipuncture from senior horses  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated using a Ficoll density gradient. PBMC were then incubated with multiple concentrations of all five polyphenols (curcuminoids, resveratrol, quercetin, pterostilbene,, hydroxypterostilbene), dissolved in DMSO to achieve the aforementioned concentrations. PBMC were stimulated the last 4h of the incubation period with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) ionomycin, Brefeldin A (BFA). PBMC were stained intracellularly for analyzed via flow cytometry. Data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Viability of PBMC incubated with various compound concentrations were compared with PBMC incubated with DMSO alone (positive control). The highest concentration at which cell viability did not significantly differ from the positive control was. The highest concentration at which viability did not significantly differ from the positive control was. Polyphenols performed similarly to or more effectively than common NSAIDs in reducing lymphocyte production of inflammatory cytokines of the senior horse in vitro.  treatments for chronic inflammation in the horse.Updated evidence on endoscopic resection of early cancer from Japan. Endoscopic resection for early cancer (EGC) plays a central role in the treatment of EGC in Japan. However, there is still room for improvement,, it is necessary to summarize the recently obtained knowledge from Japan for further improvement. We conducted a PubMed search to select relevant articles in the 5√å√¢ years until Septembesr18, 2016, using the keywords cancer, endoscopic treatment, endoscopic submucosal dissection, endoscopic mucosal resection, or polypectomy, filtering article types as clinical study or clinical trial. Among the 329 articles selected automatically from the keywords polypectomy (1 article), endoscopic mucosal resection (29 articles), endoscopic submucosal dissection (77 articles),, endoscopic treatment (222 articles) in combination with cancer, 32 relevant articles from Japanese investigators were chosen. Seven articles were categorized into equipment, 4 into preparation, sedation, 17 into complications, their prevention,, 4 into therapeutic outcomes. Among them, CO2 insufflation, propofol sedation,, how to prevent post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) ulcer bleeding, achieve post-ESD ulcer healing were intensively investigated. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic mucosal resection, ESD were also reported as favorable outcomes. Endoscopic resection for EGC is still developing toward an ideal form, pursuing a more reliable, safer,, faster minimally invasive treatment.Positional variation of applicators during low dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer: a prospective study. In order to know the effect of variation in position of applicators to the dose received by the tumor volume, critical organs such as rectum, bladder, the correlation of variation on the clinical outcome. 36 patients with histologically proven cervical cancer, undergoing intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) from Octobesr2005 to Decembesr2006 were the subjects of the study. Two pairs of orthogonal X-ray films were taken: one prior to loading of sources, the other after removal of sources. These patients were followed up as per the RTOG criteria. The median duration of insertion was 25 hours with a median follow up period of 6.7 months. The translational variation of the applicator position for all patients was 3 mm, 1 mm (2 SD), respectively, in the patient\\'s lateral, antero-posterior direction. The rotational variation was 3, 4 degrees (2 SD) in the patient\\'s transverse, sagittal planes. Detailed analysis of source movement showed following changes in median dose: point A: 14%, point B: 2%, point P: 1%, Rectum 1: 3.5%, Rectum 2: 4%, Bladder: 9.1%. The incidence of rectal toxicity was 6 36 (16.7%), that of bladder was 1 36 (2.8%). When the variables were grouped to evaluate the relationship: R2, rectal toxicity (p value: 0.002), point A, rectal toxicity (Pearson: 0.792), lateral displacement anteroposterior displacement, rectal toxicity (p value: 0.012 0.003), beta angle, R2 (p value: 0.002). The geometric relationships between the ICBT applicators, the critical structures vary during the course of low dose rate brachytherapy. Source movement does result in significant dose alterations in terms of increased rate of complications, but its impact on cure rates needs to be studied in the future.Polyphenol-Inspired Facile Construction of Smart Assemblies for ATP-, pH-Responsive Tumor MR Optical Imaging, Photothermal Therapy. Smart assemblies have attracted increased interest in various areas, especially in developing novel stimuli-responsive theranostics. Herein, commercially available, natural tannic acid (TA), iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3 O4 NPs) are utilized as models to construct smart magnetic assemblies based on polyphenol-inspired NPs-phenolic self-assembly between NPs, TA. Interestingly, the magnetic assemblies can be specially disassembled by adenosine triphosphate, which shows a stronger affinity to Fe3 O4 NPs than that of TA, partly replaces the surface coordinated TA. The disassembly can further be facilitated by the acidic environment hence causing the remarkable change of the transverse relaxivity, potent turn-on of fluorescence (FL) signals. Therefore, the assemblies for specific, sensitive tumor magnetic resonance, FL dual-modal imaging, photothermal therapy after intravenous injection of the assemblies are successfully employed. This work not only provides understandings on the self-assembly between NPs, polyphenols, but also will open new insights for facilely constructing versatile assemblies, extending their biomedical applications. novel polymorphisms in TMEM39A gene with systemic lupus erythematosus in a Chinese Han population. This study aimed to assess the association between 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes (IRF8, TMEM39A, IKZF3, ORMDL3, GSDMB,, ZPBP2), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese Han population sample. We carried out a case-control study of 415 patients with SLE, 470 healthy controls without autoimmune disease or cancer. DNA for genetic analysis was isolated from the blood of all subjects using standard phenol-chloroform method. TagSNPs were identified using genotype data from the panel (Han Chinese in Beijing) of the HapMap Project, were selected using the Haploview program. Genotyping assay was conducted using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX Gold platform. The frequencies of the alleles, genotypes were calculated, analyzed.  Studies, haplotype analysis were also performed. The genotypic frequencies of rs12493175, rs13062955 were significantly different between the SLE patients, the healthy controls. Compared with the common homozygous genotype, the CT, genotypes in rs12493175, the AC,  genotypes in rs13062955 was observed to significantly reduce the risk of SLE. Our findings identified  in SNPs located in the TMEM39A gene associated with SLE susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.TPMT, COMT, ACYP2 genetic variants in paediatric cancer patients with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Cisplatin ototoxicity affects 42-88% of treated children. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), AYCP2 genetic variants have been associated with ototoxicity, but the findings have been contradictory. The aims of the study were as follows: (a) to investigate these associations in a carefully phenotyped cohort of UK children, (b) to perform a systematic review, meta-analysis. We recruited 149 children from seven UK centres using a retrospective cohort study design. All participants were clinically phenotyped carefully. Genotyping was performed for one ACYP2 (rs1872328), three TPMT (rs12201199, rs1142345, rs1800460), two COMT (rs4646316, rs9332377) variants. For CTCAE grading, hearing loss was present in 91 120 (75.8% worst ear), 79 120 (65.8% better ear). Using Chang grading, hearing loss was diagnosed in 85 119 (71.4% worst ear) versus 75 119 (63.0% better ear). No TPMT or COMT single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with ototoxicity. ACYP2 SNP rs1872328 was associated with ototoxicity (P=0.027 worst ear). Meta-analysis of our data with that reported in previous studies showed the pooled odds_ratio (OR) to be statistically significant for both the COMT SNP rs4646316 (OR: 1.50 95% confidence interval: 1.15-1.95), the ACYP2 SNP rs1872328 (OR: 5.91 95% confidence interval: 1.51-23.16). We showed an association between the ACYP2 polymorphism, cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, but not with the TPMT, COMT. A meta-analysis was statistically significant for both the COMT rs4646316, the ACYP2 rs1872328 SNPs. Grading the hearing of children with asymmetric hearing loss requires additional clarification.EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE HYDRO-ETHANOLIC ROOT EXTRACT OF ZANTHOXYLUM ZANTHOXYLOIDES ON HEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN CYCLOPHOSPAMIDE TREATED RATS.  Animals were divided into 6 groups of 6 rats each, were pretreated oral doses of 75, 150, 225 mg kg of the extract for 7 days, then co-administered with 2.5 mg kg cyclophosphamide for 28 days. The LD50 of the extract was found to be 1682.3 mg kg. In the anti-oxidant enzyme assay, CAT was significantly (p < 0.05) increased for animals treated with 150 mg kg CP compared to 75 mg kg CP, 225 mg kg CP. GPx was significantly (p < 0.01) increased in rats treated with 75 mg kg CP compared to 150 mg kg CP, control. SOD was significantly (p < 0.01) increased in rats treated with 75 mg kg CP compared to the control. WBC was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced for 225 mg kg, 225 mg kg CP (p < 0.001), 150 mg kg CP (p < 0.001), 75 mg kg CP (p < 0.001), CP administered rats (p < 0.001) respectively compared to the control. LDL, CHOL were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) for rats treated with 75 mg kg CP, 225 mg kg CP, 225 mg kg. Phenol Concentrations During Childhood, Subsequent Measures of Adiposity Among Young Girls. Phenolic compounds represent a class of environmental chemicals with potentially endocrine-disrupting capabilities. We investigated longitudinal associations between childhood exposure to phenols, from both manmade, natural sources,, subsequent measures of adiposity among girls enrolled in Cancer, the Research Program between 2004, 2007. Baseline (ages 6-8 years) urinary concentrations were obtained for creatinine, phenol metabolites. Body mass index (weight (kg) height (m)2), waist circumference,, percent body fat were measured at annual or semiannual examinations through 2015 (n = 1,017). Linear mixed-effects regression was used to estimate how baseline concentrations of phenols (tertile groups) were related to changes in girls\\' adiposity measurements from ages 7 through 15 years. Enterolactone was inversely associated with body mass index, waist circumference,, percent body fat, while 2,5-dichlorophenol was positively associated with these measurements. A nonmonotonic association was observed for triclosan, girls\\' adiposity however, it was due to effect modification by baseline overweight status. Triclosan was positively associated with adiposity only among overweight girls. These results suggest that exposure to specific phenols during childhood may influence adiposity through adolescence.Primary Biliary Cholangitis: advances in management, treatment of the disease. Primary Biliary Cholangitis, previously known as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, is a rare disease, which mainly affects women in their fifth to seventh decades of life. It is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by a progressive damage of interlobular bile ducts leading to ductopenia, chronic cholestasis, bile acids retention. Even if the disease usually presents a long asymptomatic phase, a slow progression, in many patients it may progress faster toward cirrhosis, its complications. The 10year mortality is greater than in diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, breast cancer. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the only treatment available today, but even if effective in counteracting the disease progression for the majority of patients, in approximately 40% is not able to decrease effectively the alkaline phosphatase, a surrogate marker of disease activity. Recently, obeticholic acid received the European Medicines Agency conditional approval, as add on treatment in patients non responders or intolerant to ursodeoxycholic acid. The present paper illustrates the opinion of a working group, composed by clinical pharmacologists, gastroenterologists hepatologists with specific expertise on Primary Biliary Cholangitis, patient associations, on the state of the art, future perspectives of the disease management. The agreement on the document was reached through an Expert Meeting. Comparison of sedation between the endoscopy room, operation room during endoscopic submucosal dissection for neoplasms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The present study was performed to compare the safety of sedation during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the endoscopy room versus operation room. In total, 297 patients with gastrointestinal tumors who underwent ESD from January 2011 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent ESD in the endoscopy room without propofol (Group E) versus operation room with propofol (Group O). The patient, tumor,, procedure characteristics adverse events, treatment outcomes were compared between the two groups. The patient, tumor characteristics, including age, comorbidities,, tumor size, histology, were not different between Groups E, O. The ESD procedure time was comparable between Groups E, O the anesthesia time was equivalent. There were no significant differences in adverse events between the two groups. During the ESD procedure, desaturation occurred significantly more often in Group E than O. The recovery time after ESD was significantly longer in Group E than O (180 (100-360) vs. 90 (0-180) min. A decreased desaturation rate, shorter recovery time after ESD were the advantages of sedation in the operation room with propofol compared with sedation in the endoscopy room. These findings warrant further exploration of the advantages of safe, effective ESD for upper gastrointestinal neoplasms in the operation room.Does the oncology community have a rejection bias when it comes to repurposed drugs? Among the various measures proposed to combat the challenge of financial toxicity in cancer care, an important strategy is the use of lower-priced drugs instead of expensive alternatives. However, the oncology community seems to either ignore or more readily reject cheaper drugs in cancer care compared to more expensive alternatives. In this commentary, we present three examples of lower-priced drugs rejected or ignored by the oncology community, contrast this with three expensive drugs where persistent optimism remained despite negative clinical trial results. We argue that all drugs be held to the same rigorous standards - this not only includes skepticism in the absence of sound evidence, but also the suspension of premature judgement as has happened in the cases of repurposed drugs.Inducers of Senescence, Toxic Compounds,, Senolytics: The Multiple Faces of Nrf2-Activating in Cancer Adjuvant Therapy. The reactivation of senescence in cancer, the subsequent clearance of senescent are suggested as intervention in the cancer. We herein describe in vitro, in vivo effects on cellular senescence. In light of available literature, it can be concluded that the meaning, the potential of adjuvant therapy with natural compounds in humans remain unclear, also taking into account the existence of few clinical trials mostly characterized by uncertain results. Further studies are needed to investigate the therapeutic potential of those compounds that display senolytic activity.Assessment of the Endocrine Disrupting Compounds on the Development of Vertebrate Neural Network Function Using Multi-electrode Arrays. Bis-phenols, such as bis-phenol A (BPA), bis-phenol-S (BPS), are polymerizing agents widely used in the production of plastics, numerous everyday products. They are classified as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) with estradiol-like properties. Long-term exposure to EDCs, even at low doses, has been linked with various health defects including cancer, behavioral disorders,, infertility, with greater vulnerability during early developmental periods. To study the effects of BPA on the development of neuronal function, we used an in vitro neuronal network derived from the early chick embryonic brain as a model.  There are several systems available in the market and, although there are variations in the number of electrodes, the type, quality of the electrode array, the analysis software, the basic underlying principles,, the data obtained is the same across the different systems. Although currently limited to analysis of two-dimensional in vitro cultures, these MEA systems are being improved to enable in vivo network activity in brain slices. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for embryonic exposure, recording neuronal network activity, synchrony, along with representative results.Dietary polyphenol intake, their major food sources in the Mexican Teachers\\' Cohort. Several descriptive studies on the intake of polyphenols, mostly flavonoids, have been published, especially in Europe, the USA, but insufficient data are still available in Latin-American countries, where different types of foods are consumed, different dietary habits are observed. The goal of this cross-sectional study was to estimate dietary intakes of polyphenols, including grand total, total per classes, subclasses, individual compounds,, to identify their main food sources in Mexican women. The Mexican Teachers\\' Cohort includes 115 315 female teachers, 25 years, older, from twelve states of Mexico, including urban, rural areas. Dietary data were collected in the period 2008-2011 using a validated FFQ,, individual polyphenol intake was estimated using food composition data from the Phenol-Explorer database. Median total polyphenol intake was the highest in Baja California (750 mg d), the lowest in Yucatan (536 mg d). The main polyphenols consumed were phenolic acids (56√å√¢√•√°3-68√å√¢√•√°5 % total polyphenols), followed by flavonoids (28√å√¢√•√°8-40√å√¢√•√°9 %). Intake of other polyphenol subclasses (stilbenes, lignans, others) was insignificant. Coffee, fruits were the most important food sources of phenolic acids, flavonoids, respectively. Intake of a total of 287 different individual polyphenols could be estimated, of which forty-two were consumed in an amount √å¬¢\\x89√õ¬°√•¬¥1 mg d. The most largely consumed polyphenols were several caffeoylquinic acids (ranging from 20, 460 mg d), ferulic acid, hesperidin, proanthocyanidins. This study shows a large heterogeneity in intakes of individual polyphenols among Mexican women, but a moderate heterogeneity across Mexican states. Main food sources were also similar in the different states.Mucosa of human detrusor impairs contraction and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation. To elucidate the impact of the mucosa on detrusor muscle function by investigating force of contraction under various stimulatory conditions and during subsequent relaxation using catecholamines. Detrusor tissue was obtained from patients who had undergone cystectomy for  cancer and strips of intact or mucosa-denuded muscle were set up for force measurement. Preparations were precontracted with KCl, carbachol or electric-field stimulation (EFS). Precontracted strips were relaxed using increasing concentrations of catecholamines in the absence and presence of the subtype-selective beta-adrenoceptor (AR) blockers CGP 20712A (beta1-ARs), ICI 118,551 (beta2-ARs), and L-748,337 (beta3-ARs). Force development in response to KCl (40√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°mM), carbachol (1√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å?√•?M) or EFS was larger in the absence of mucosa than in intact muscle strips. The force of contraction of mucosa-denuded strips with detached urothelium incubated in the same chamber was as low as in intact strips. Noradrenaline relaxed precontracted detrusor strips to a significantly larger extent and at lower concentrations in denuded than in intact strips. CGP 20712A did not affect noradrenaline-induced relaxation of denuded and intact strips, and ICI 118,551 did not influence noradrenaline-induced relaxation in denuded strips, but abolished the difference between denuded and intact strips. The antagonism of the relaxant effects of noradrenaline by L-748,337 was slightly smaller in intact than denuded strips. The mucosa of human detrusor strips impairs force development when stimulated with KCl, carbachol or EFS. The mucosa also blunts the relaxing effects of catecholamines. The latter effect does not involve the beta1-ARs but only of beta2-ARs, whereas beta3-ARs mediate the relaxation of human detrusor.  Disorders of innate immunity in human ageing and effects of nutraceutical administration. Immune decline with ageing accounts for the increased risk of infections, inflammatory chronic disease, autoimmunity and cancer in humans. Both innate and adaptive immune functions are compromised in aged people and, therefore, attempts to correct these dysfunctions represent a major goal of modern medicine. In this review, special emphasis will be placed on the aged innate immunity. As potential modifiers of the impaired innate immunity, some principal nutraceuticals will be illustrated, such as micronutrients, pre-probiotics and polyphenols. In elderly, clinical trials with the above products are scanty. SPOt: A novel and streamlined microarray platform for observing cellular tRNA levels. Recent studies have placed transfer RNA (tRNA), a housekeeping molecule, in the heart of fundamental cellular processes such as embryonic development and tumor progression. Such discoveries were contingent on the concomitant development of methods able to deliver high-quality tRNA profiles. The present study describes the proof of concept obtained in Escherichia coli (E. coli) for an original tRNA analysis platform named SPOt (Streamlined Platform for Observing tRNA). This approach comprises three steps. First, E. coli cultures are spiked with radioactive orthophosphate second, labeled total RNAs are trizol-extracted third, RNA samples are hybridized on in-house printed microarrays and spot signals, the proxy for tRNA levels, are quantified by phosphorimaging. Features such as reproducibility and specificity were assessed using several tRNA subpopulations. Dynamic range and sensitivity were evaluated by overexpressing specific tRNA species. SPOt does not require any amplification or post-extraction labeling and can be adapted to any organism. It is modular and easily streamlined with popular techniques such as polysome fractionation to profile tRNAs interacting with ribosomes and actively engaged in translation. The biological relevance of these data is discussed in regards to codon usage, tRNA gene copy number, and position on the genome.Influence of Freeze-Thaw Cycles on RNA Integrity of Gastrointestinal Cancer and Matched Adjacent Tissues. Comparative analysis of RNA expression profiles between cancer and adjacent noncancerous tissues is an important part of cancer research. High-quality RNA is essential for consistent, reliable results, especially for identification of cancer. However, the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on the quality of RNA both in cancer and paired adjacent tissues is still unclear. To investigate the influence of freeze-thaw cycles on RNA integrity and overall histomorphology of cancer and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. Gastrointestinal cancer and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues were frozen and thawed twice before extracting RNA. Total RNA in each sample was extracted with TRIzol reagents and the RNA integrity was assessed by RNA integrity number (RIN) on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Light microscopy was then used to assess tissue composition and morphology. RIN values for all samples tended to correlation with the frequency of freeze-thawing. With an RIN cutoff value of 6, RNA extracted from cancer tissues was not qualified after the first freeze-thaw. Moreover, all RNA extracted from adjacent noncancerous tissues had nonqualifying RIN scores after the first freeze-thaw except for tissues. Microscopically, all samples displayed qualified tissue morphology regardless of freeze-thaw frequency. Freeze-thawing affects the RNA integrity, but not the tissue morphology of gastrointestinal cancer and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, the RNA extracted from adjacent noncancerous tissues is more easily degraded than that in cancer tissues.Preventive supplementation with fresh and preserved peach attenuates CCl4-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and tissue damage. The present study was elaborated to comparatively evaluate the preventive effect of different peach-derived products obtained from preserved fruits (Syrup and Preserve Pulp Peach [PPP]) and from fresh peels and pulps (Peel and Fresh Pulp Peach [FPP]) in a model of liver/renal toxicity and inflammation induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in rats. Tissue damage (carbonyl, thiobarbituric acid reactive species and sulfhydril), antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase and superoxide dismutase) and inflammatory parameters [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta levels, and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and nuclear factor (NF)kB-p65 immunocontent] were investigated. Our findings demonstrated that Peel, PPP and FPP (200 or 400 mg/kg) daily administration by oral gavage for 30 days conferred a protection against CCl4-induced antioxidant enzymes. This antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effect seems to be associated with the abundance of carotenoids and polyphenols present in peach-derived products, which are enriched in fresh-fruit-derived preparations (Peel and FPP) but are also present in PPP. Therefore, the herein presented results show evidence that supplementation with peach products may be protective against organ caused by oxidative stress, being interesting candidates for production of antioxidant-enriched functional foods.Septic endarteritis due to intra-arterial catheters for cancer chemotherapy. I. Evaluation of an outbreak. II. Risk factors, clinical features and management, III. Guidelines for prevention. A cluster of three cases of staphylococcal septic endarteritis originating from percutaneously inserted brachial artery catheters for regional cancer chemotherapy prompted an epidemiologic and clinical study of bacteremic infections associated with this therapeutic modality. Nine cases were identified over a 3 1/2-year period (1.6% of all catheterizations), all caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The cluster followed discontinuation of hexachlorophene for scrub of the extremity prior to cannulation phage-typing suggested the three cases were caused by the patients\\' own strains of Staphylococcus. These infections produced a distinctive clinical syndrome which facilitates implicating the catheter in the genesis of fever occurring in a patient receiving intra-arterial chemotherapy: early localized pain (89%) and hemorrhage (78%), and Osler\\'s nodes distally (44%), later followed by local inflammation (78%), purulence (56%) and signs of systemic sepsis (100%) (each factor, p less than or equal to .005). Duration of cannulation did not influence susceptibility to infection. However, difficult cannulations or need for repositioning the catheter (p = .0096), prior radiation therapy (p = .033), leukopenia (p less than .05) and hypoalbuminemia (p less than .05) were all associated with septicemia. In the 25 months since implementation of specific control measures, there have been no further catheter-related septicemia in 310 catheterization (p less than .001). Guide-lines for prevention and management of these infections are provided.NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Pentachlorophenol (CAS NO. 87-86-5) in F344/N Rats (Feed Studies). Pentachlorophenol has been used as an herbicide, algicide, defoliant, wood preservative, germicide, fungicide, and molluscicide. Pentachlorophenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute for carcinogenicity testing based on its widespread use as a wood preservative, potential for entering the environment (pentachlorophenol residues have been found worldwide in soil, water, and air samples in food products and in human and animal tissues and body fluids), and likelihood of bioaccumulation in the environment (pentachlorophenol is persistent in soil, having a half-life of up to 5 years). Technical Report No. 349 contains the results of the 2-year studies of pentachlorophenol performed by the NTP with B6C3F1 mice. Male and female F344/N rats were exposed to pentachlorophenol (approximately 99% pure) in feed for 28 days or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in vitro in Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vivo in rat and mouse bone marrow cells. 28-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats were given 0, 200, 400, 800, 1,600, or 3,200 ppm pentachlorophenol, equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 75, 150, or 270 mg pentachlorophenol/kg body weight to males and females in feed for 28 days. With the exception of one male and two females exposed to 3,200 ppm, all rats survived until the end of the study. The final mean body weights and body weight gains of male rats exposed to 1,600 or 3,200 ppm and female rats exposed to 400, 800, 1,600, or 3,200 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls rats exposed to 3,200 ppm lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by 3,200 ppm males was less than that by the control group throughout the study. The absolute and relative liver weights of 400, 800, and 1,600 ppm males and all exposed groups of females were significantly greater than those of the controls. Compared to the control groups, the incidences of minimal to mild hepatocyte degeneration in males and females exposed to 400 ppm or greater and the incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy in the 3,200 ppm groups were increased. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were fed diets containing 200, 400, or 600 ppm pentachlorophenol (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Stop-exposure groups of 60 male and 60 female rats received 1,000 ppm (equivalent to 60 mg/kg) in feed for 52 weeks, after which animals received undosed feed for the remainder of the 2-year study 10 male and 10 female control and 1,000 ppm rats were evaluated at 7 months. Survival, Body Weights,and Feed Consumption: In the 2-year study, survival of 600 and 1,000 ppm males was greater than that of the controls. Mean body weights of 400 and 600 ppm males and females were generally less than those of controls. When exposure to pentachlorophenol was discontinued at week 52, mean body weights of 1,000 ppm males and females were 17%% and 22%% lower than those of the respective controls however, by the end of week 87, the mean body weights were similar to those of the controls. Generally, feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls. Pathology Findings: At 2 years, the incidence of malignant mesothelioma originating from the tunica vaginalis was significantly greater in 1,000 ppm males than in the controls, and the incidence exceeded the historical control range. Nasal squamous cell carcinomas were present in one control male, three 200 ppm males, one 400 ppm male, and five 1,000 ppm males at 2 years, and the incidence in 1,000 ppm males exceeded the historical control range. At the 7-month interim evaluation, the incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy in 1,000 ppm males and females and hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization in 1,000 ppm males was significantly greater than those in the controls. At 2 years, the incidences of several nonneoplastic liver lesions including hepatodiaphragmatic nodules and hepatocyte cystic degeneration in all exposed ation in all exposed groups of males and basophilic foci in 1,000 ppm males were increased compared to the controls. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Pentachlorophenol (91.6%percnt pure) was tested in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 at doses up to 30 mug/plate with and without induced rat or hamster liver S9 no significant increases in the number of revertant colonies were observed in any of the strain/activation combinations. When tested for cytogenetic effects in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, pentachlorophenol was weakly positive for induction of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations. In the sister chromatid exchange test, a weakly positive response was observed within a concentration range of 3 to 30 mug/mL in the absence of S9 with S9, no induction of sister chromatid exchanges was noted. In the chromosomal aberrations test, pentachlorophenol was negative without S9 but induced small but significant increases in the frequency of aberrant cells in the presence of S9 at doses of 80 and 100 mug/mL. In contrast to the positive in vitro results in the test for induction of chromosomal aberrations, no increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was noted in bone marrow of male rats or mice administered pentachlorophenol by intraperitoneal injection three times at 24 hour intervals. The highest dose administered to rats (75 mg/kg) and mice (150 mg/kg) was lethal. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year feed study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachlorophenol in male or female F344/N rats fed diets containing 200, 400, or 600 ppm. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachlorophenol in male F344/N rats given feed containing 1,000 ppm for 1 year followed by control feed for 1 year (stop-exposure study), based on increased incidences of mesothelioma and nasal squamous cell carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachlorophenol in female rats given feed containing 1,000 ppm for 1 year and maintained on control feed for 1 year. Stop-exposure males and females recovered from a transitory reduction in body weight gain by the end of the 2-year study, and males had increased survival compared to the controls. Counting missing values in a metabolite-intensity data set for measuring the analytical performance of a metabolomics platform. Metabolomics requires quantitative comparison of individual metabolites present in an entire sample set. Unfortunately, missing intensity values in one or more samples are very common. Because missing values can have a profound influence on metabolomic results, the extent of missing values found in a metabolomic data set should be treated as an important parameter for measuring the analytical performance of a technique. In this work, we report a study on the scope of missing values and a robust method of filling the missing values in a chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS metabolomics platform. Unlike conventional LC-MS, CIL LC-MS quantifies the concentration differences of individual metabolites in two comparative samples based on the mass spectral peak intensity ratio of a peak pair from a mixture of differentially labeled samples. We show that this peak-pair feature can be explored as a unique means of extracting metabolite intensity information from raw mass spectra. In our approach, a peak-pair peaking algorithm, IsoMS, is initially used to process the LC-MS data set to generate a CSV file or table that contains metabolite ID and peak ratio information (i.e., metabolite-intensity table). A zero-fill program, freely available from MyCompoundID.org , is developed to automatically find a missing value in the CSV file and go back to the raw LC-MS data to find the peak pair and, then, calculate the intensity ratio and enter the ratio value into the table. Most of the missing values are found to be low abundance peak pairs. We demonstrate the performance of this method in analyzing an experimental and technical replicate data set of human urine metabolome. Furthermore, we propose a standardized approach of counting missing values in a replicate data set as a way of gauging the extent of missing values in a metabolomics platform. Finally, we illustrate that applying the zero-fill program, in conjunction with dansylation CIL LC-MS, can lead to a marked improvement in finding significant metabolites that differentiate bladder cancer patients and their controls in a metabolomics study of 109 subjects. Synthesis of [11C]FEDAA1106 as a new PET imaging probe of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor expression. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is associated with neuroinflammation and tumor progression. [(11)C]DAA1106 and [(18)F]FEDAA1106 are two promising radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of PBR. This study was designed to develop a new radiolabeled analog of [(11)C]DAA1106 and [(18)F]FEDAA1106, [(11)C]FEDAA1106, for PET imaging of PBR expression in brain and cancer. Precursor N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-5-hydroxybenzyl)acetamide (9) was synthesized in multiple steps with moderate to high chemical yields. Precursor 9 was labeled by [(11)C]CH(3)OTf and isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification to provide target radioligand N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-5-[(11)C]methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(11)C]FEDAA1106, [(11)C]10) in 60-70% radiochemical yields, decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB), based on [(11)C]CO(2). The specific activity of the radiotracer [(11)C]10 was in a range of 111-185GBq/micromol at the end of synthesis (EOS).The Application of Sigmoid Sinus Tunnel-packing or Push-packing of the Inferior Petrous Sinus in the Microsurgical Management of Jugular Paragangliomas. To analyze the outcomes of microsurgically treated jugular paragangliomas with control of bleeding from the inferior petrous sinus. Retrospective patient review. A single university hospital. Forty-three patients with jugular paragangliomas were diagnosed in the past 7 years in our clinic. Surgical tumor control, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative management of the facial nerve, and the preoperative and postoperative function of the lower central nerves. Twenty-six patients underwent microsurgical treatment. Eighteen tumors were class C2 (69.2%), six were class C3 (23.1%), and two were class CDe1 (7.7%). Gross total tumor resection was achieved in 92.3% of the patients. The mean blood loss during surgery was 438.5 ml. The recurrence rate was 3.8% over a mean follow-up of 29.2 months. New facial palsy and lower cranial nerve deficit occurred in 42.3 and 11.5% of the patients, respectively. The infratemporal fossa approach type A with sigmoid sinus tunnel-packing or push-packing technique facilitated the control of bleeding from the inferior petrous sinus and improved the outcomes of microsurgical treatment for jugular paragangliomas.Exact statistical tests for any carcinogenic effect in animal bioassays. II. Age-adjusted tests. Statistical methods are discussed for application in animal carcinogenesis bioassays that test a general null hypothesis that response frequencies are independent of the treatment level for all tumor endpoints, sexes, and species considered in the bioassay, conditional on survival. These methods are similar to those proposed earlier by Farrar and Crump (1988, Fundam, Appl. Toxicol. 11, 652-663) which involve test statistics that are functions of p values from multiple standard statistical hypothesis tests, and evaluation of significance using randomization. Refinements include the introduction of an exact incidental tumor test analogous to the asymptotic test of Hoel and Walburg (1972, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 49, 361-372), which takes into account the possibility that any differences among treatment groups in response rates result from differences in survival that is independent of tumors. Additional consideration is given to selection of test statistics, and a test is proposed that is sensitive specifically to cases where the same tumor endpoints are affected in multiple sexes and species. Applications of the procedures to results of National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassays concerning decabromodiphenyl oxide and iodinated glycerol illustrate the sensitivity of tests based on different test statistics to distinct alternative hypotheses. When compared with the qualitative conclusions of the NTP regarding the strength of evidence for a carcinogenic effect in the same bioassays, the results presented suggest that the methods can be useful in clarifying otherwise equivocal evidence for carcinogenicity. Various difficulties are discussed relevant to the construction of exact combined fatal and incidental tumor tests analogous to the tests of Peto et al. (1980, IARC Monogr. Suppl. 2).A birth cohort analysis of the incidence of papillary thyroid cancer in the United States, 1973-2004. The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer has been reported to be increasing during the past three decades, with a 65-126% increase between 1975 and 2004. The reason for the increase is currently unknown. This study examined the incidence pattern of papillary thyroid cancer in the United States, and evaluated the components of birth cohort (defined based on year of birth), time period, and age as determinants of the observed time trend of the disease. Using the data from the National Cancer Institute\\'s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program for 1973-2004, we conducted both univariate analysis and age-period-cohort modeling to evaluate birth cohort patterns and evaluate age, period, and cohort effects on incidence trends over time. The increasing incidence showed a clear birth cohort pattern for both men and women. The results from age-period-cohort modeling showed that, while period effect appeared to have had an impact on the observed incidence trends, birth cohort effect may also explain part of the increasing trend in papillary thyroid carcinoma during the study period, especially among women. While a period effect that is likely due to advancements in diagnostic techniques and increased medical detection of small thyroid nodules may explain some of the observed increase in the incidence, we speculate that birth cohort-related changes in environmental exposures (such as increased exposure to diagnostic X-rays and polybrominated diphenyl ethers) have also contributed to the observed increase in papillary thyroid cancer during the past decades.Partial hepatectomy on cirrhotic liver with a right lateral tumor. A total of 24 patients with cirrhotic liver and solitary, small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located at the lateral part of the right lobe underwent surgery with our technique of hepatic clamping and finger dissection. There were no operative mortality or acute or chronic hepatic failure. Total operating time was 129 +/- 20 minutes actual resection time was only 22.7 +/- 4.9 minutes. The average amount of blood transfused during this procedure was 1552 +/- 909 ml. The preoperative serum bromsulphalein retention rate proportionately reflected the postoperative peak serum conjugated bilirubin concentration if the weight of the resected specimen was less than 310 gm (p less than 0.001). An evaluation of the enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, and lactate dehydrogenase) released from liver cells on the first postoperative day found that more prominent elevation was observed in the group of patients with hypotension than in those without hypotension (all p less than 0.001). Although all enzyme levels returned to the preoperative level on the fourteenth postoperative day, the excretory capacity of liver cells as measured by serum bromsulphalein retention rate on day 14 time was still abnormally high (p less than 0.001) and took 2 to 3 months to decline to a level that still exceeded preoperative levels (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, partial hepatectomy on cirrhotic liver by hepatic clamping and finger dissection was a simple, rapid technique without any serious side effects.Application of silver stains to cytologic specimens of neuroendocrine tumors metastatic to the liver. Cytologic specimens of neuroendocrine tumors metastatic to the liver were examined with regard to their silver staining properties after the application of argentaffin and argyrophil staining techniques (Masson, Grimelius and Sevier-Munger). In tumors with a content of serotonin (small intestine carcinoids), the presence of this substance was demonstrated cytologically as an argentaffin reaction in individual tumor cells however, formalin fixation was a prerequisite for positive staining. Melanin in malignant melanoma cells displayed a positive argentaffin reaction, irrespective of the fixation used (air drying, formalin, Bouin\\'s fluid or acetone-alcohol). Thus, serotonin and melanin can be distinguished in cytologic samples of neuroendocrine tumors by the use of the Masson argentaffin reaction with different fixatives. The nonargentaffin-positive neuroendocrine were weakly stained or unreactive with the Grimelius argyrophil technique. The Sevier-Munger argyrophil technique was negative or gave a disturbing nonspecific background staining reaction that was difficult to interpret in the cytologic samples. Thus, the Grimelius method appears to be the most useful silver stain for identifying neuroendocrine tumor cells in cytologic material, irrespective of their hormone content, since both argentaffin-positive and argentaffin-negative samples were stained at least to some degree.Cell blotting: techniques for staining and microscopical examination of cells blotted on nitrocellulose paper. Standard cytological and histological staining procedures were successfully applied on nitrocellulose (NC) paper for staining a spectrum of cell types that were blotted on it. The staining procedures included a Papanicolaou method, a hematoxylin and eosin method, and an immunoperoxidase technique. The types consisted of various suspension and monolayer cultures as well as freshly prepared from tumor and nontumor tissues. Suspended cells were manually blotted on NC paper they were fixed in one of the fixatives, which included 80% 2-propanol, 10% neutral-buffered formalin, Carnoy\\'s solution, Bouin\\'s fluid, and B-5 fixative they were then stained by one or more of the above methods. After staining, the NC paper was dehydrated in absolute 2-propanol made transparent by soaking in xylene mounted permanently in a mounting medium (Permount) on a glass slide and then examined under a microscope. The protein-blotting capacity of NC paper (Schleicher  Schuell) was compared with those of the conventional cell blotting media (Millipore and Gelman) which contained cellulose acetate. Bovine serum albumin was dot-blotted on the NC and the cellulose acetate filters, and stained for protein by amido black. As in cytological/histological staining, the amido black-stained filters were dehydrated in absolute 2-propanol, made transparent in xylene, and mounted in Permount. Densitometric tracings indicated that the NC paper bound the highest amount of protein. The feasibility of cytological/histological staining techniques on NC paper combined with its high protein-blotting capacity allowed in situ staining and microscopical characterization of baby hamster kidney cells binding to fibronectin blotted on the NC paper. The possible significance of these techniques in current cell biological research was discussed.Cytologic diagnosis of a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid by Sevier-Munger silver staining and calcitonin immunocytochemistry. A medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was preoperatively diagnosed on ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration biopsies. After cytocentrifugation, the tumor cells displayed a dense cytoplasmic silver granulation with the Sevier-Munger technique when applied to air-dried or acetone-ethanol-fixed samples and an obvious calcitonin immunoreactivity after fixation in Bouin\\'s fluid. These methods may prove useful in the identification of nonpalpable metastases and recurrences of medullary carcinomas of the thyroid, especially since the cytologic typing of medullary thyroid carcinoma cells may be difficult with routine stainings.Sorting out mix-ups. The provenance of tissue sections may be confirmed by PCR using microsatellite markers. Standard identification systems usually ensure that biopsy material is correctly associated with a given patient. Sometimes, as when a tumor is unexpectedly found, the provenance (proof of origin) of a tissue sample may be questioned the tissue may have been mislabelled or contaminated with tissue from another patient. Techniques used to confirm tissue provenance include comparing either tissue markers of gender or ABO blood groups however, these methods have weak confirmatory power. Recently, the use of DNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques has been reported. Paired, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, 10 microns tissue sections were selected from 17 patients, 8 of whom had carcinoma, either by dividing a biopsy section, using sequential biopsies, or sequential biopsy and autopsy tissue. The resulting 36 samples were coded before analysis. In two additional cases, 1-mm fragments of tumor from one patient were included in the tissue block of benign tissue from another patient, the tumor fragments were identified on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections, separately scraped off the glass slide, and analyzed. Tissue from two clinical cases, one of suspected mislabelling and one with a suspected carry-over of malignant tissue were also investigated. Short tandem repeat sequences (STR) or microsatellites, are 2-5 base pair repeats that vary in their repeat number between individuals. This variation (polymorphism) can be assessed using a PCR. A panel of markers of 3 STRs ACPP, INT 2, and CYP 19 (on chromosomes 3, 11, and 15, respectively) were used. DNA was isolated from the samples after xylene deparaffinization and proteinase digestion, and was then amplified in a radioactive PCR using primers selected to give a product size ranging from 136-178 bases. Amplified products were electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, dried, and autoradiographed. DNA segments were successfully extracted from all samples but one, which was fixed in Bouin\\'s fluid. By comparing allele sizes from the panel, all tissue pairs (other than the Bouin\\'s pair) were successfully matched, the 1-mm tumor fragments were correctly assigned, and the two clinical problems were solved. STRs are highly informative and robust markers, well suited to PCR of small portions of tissue sections, and are an effective method to confirm the provenance of benign and malignant biopsy and autopsy material.Caveolin-1 as a potential high-risk prostate cancer biomarker. Current diagnostic techniques of prostate cancer cannot efficiently distinguish the latent and low-risk forms from the high-risk significant forms of prostate cancer. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), except other functions, plays an important role in cell transformation and the process of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, Cav-1 is involved in metastatic processes. It has also been shown that Cav-1 expression is induced under stress conditions, such as oxidative stress. The present study focused on the determination of prognostic markers of aggressive (high-grade) forms of prostate cancer. We determined serum Cav-1 and serum markers of antioxidant activity-glutathione (GSH), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), N,N-dimethyl-1,4-diaminobenzene (DMPD), free radicals method (FRK) and blue chromium peroxide (Cro) in 97 serum samples (82 prostate cancer patients and 15 controls). We found insignificant differences in Cav-1 between the sera of patients and controls (5.69√å√¢ in the cancer group vs. 5.42√å√¢ ng/ml in the control group). However, we found a significant (p<0.004) 2.8-fold elevation of Cav-1 in high tumor stages (TNM T4) compared to lower stages and a significant positive association with histological grading (r=0.29, p=0.028). We also found that in patients with high serum Cav-1 the antioxidant capacity of the body is reduced. These findings indicate that Cav-1 may be an interesting tool for the prediction of disease burden.Cyclotron production of (44)Sc: From bench to bedside. (44)Sc, a PET radionuclide, has promising decay characteristics (T1/2 = 3.97 h, Ebeta(+)av = 632 keV) for nuclear imaging and is an attractive alternative to the short-lived (68)Ga (T1/2 = 68 min, Ebeta(+)av = 830 keV). The aim of this study was the optimization of the (44)Sc production process at an accelerator, allowing its use for preclinical and clinical PET imaging. (44)CaCO3 targets were prepared and irradiated with protons (~11 MeV) at a beam current of 50 √å?√•?A for 90 min. (44)Sc was separated from its target material using DGA extraction resin and concentrated using SCX cation exchange resin. Radiolabeling experiments at activities up to 500 MBq and stability tests were performed with DOTANOC by investigating different scavengers, including gentisic acid. Dynamic PET of an AR42J tumor-bearing mouse was performed after injection of (44)Sc-DOTANOC. The optimized chemical separation method yielded up to 2 GBq (44)Sc of high radionuclidic purity. In the presence of gentisic acid, radiolabeling of (44)Sc with DOTANOC was achieved with a radiochemical yield of ~99% at high specific activity (10 MBq/nmol) and quantities which would allow clinical application. The dynamic PET images visualized increasing uptake of (44)Sc-DOTANOC into AR42J tumors and excretion of radioactivity through the kidneys of the investigated mouse. The concept from-bench-to-bedside was clearly demonstrated in this extended study using cyclotron-produced (44)Sc. Sufficiently high activities of (44)Sc of excellent radionuclidic purity are obtainable for clinical application, by irradiation of enriched calcium at a cyclotron. This work demonstrates a promising basis for introducing (44)Sc to clinical routine of nuclear imaging using PET.Good results after Hartmann\\'s operation for rectal cancer in high risk patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of per- and postoperative complications of low anterior resection and Hartmann\\'s operation (HO) for rectal cancer. The study was performed in a department with a high frequency of HO. Patients who had undergone low anterior resection (LA) or HO for rectal cancer at the Department of Surgery, Gentofte Hospital, between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2007. A total of 187 patients were operated using LA or HO technique during this period. LA was performed in 103 patients and HO in 84 patients. ASA-scores were significantly higher for patients who underwent HO (p = 0.0066). There was no significant difference in complication rates between the two groups (p = 0.385). The 30-day mortality rate was 3.2% (n = 6) for all patients, and it was not significantly different between the two groups (HO 3.6% (n = 3) and LA= 2.9% (n = 3), p = 1). One ASA III patient who underwent LA died from anastomotic leakage whereas no ASA III patients operated with HO died. There was no significant difference between the groups for any other per- and postoperative complication. In this material, HO rather than LA seems to be the safer choice for high risk rectal cancer patients with ASA > 3 in terms of mortality rate compared with the national index.Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of osteoid osteomas: technique and results. Osteoid osteoma is a benign primary bone tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. Besides local pain, which is often worse at night, prompt relief due to medication with acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) is characteristic for this bone lesion. Because long-term medication with ASS does not represent an alternative treatment strategy due to its potentially severe side effects, different minimally invasive image-guided techniques for the therapy of osteoid osteoma have been developed. In this context radiofrequency (RF) ablation in particular has become part of the clinical routine. The technique and results of image-guided RF ablation are compared to alternative treatment strategies. Using this technique, an often needle-shaped RF applicator is percutaneously placed into the tumor under image guidance. Then a high-frequency alternating current is applied by the tip of the applicator which leads to ionic motion within the tissue resulting in local heat development and thus in thermal destruction of the surrounding tissue including the tumor. The published primary and secondary success rates of this technique are 87 and 83 %, respectively. Surgical resection and open curettage show comparable success rates but are associated with higher complication rates. In addition image-guided RF ablation of osteoid osteomas is associated with low costs. In conclusion image-guided RF ablation can be considered the gold standard for the treatment of osteoid osteomaThe effects of oral acetylsalicylic acid on√å√¢ blood fluidity and infusion speed in√å√¢ the√å√¢ cancer patients with PICC. This study aimed to examine the influence of oral acetylsalicylic acid on blood fluidity and infusion speed in the cancer patients with Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC). PICC is placed for prolonged chemotherapy of cancer patients. The fibrin sheaths, which consist of cellular substance and non-cellular substance, generate at the place of insertion and grow down all over the catheter. Finally they cover the vent of the catheter and lead to catheter dysfunctions such as the decrease of infusion speed. In addition, the high viscosity status of cancer patients could lead to acute embolization, which adds to the high risk of death. Randomized controlled trial. This research was carried out between April 2013 and January 2014 in the second hospital of Xiangya, Central South University in Changsha, China. Initially 96 cancer participants with PICC were chosen and randomly allocated to experimental and control group. The participants of the experimental group were conducted route PICC maintain technique and took acetylsalicylic acid 100√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ämg per day after dinner, while the control group received route PICC maintain technique only. The infusion speed and hemorheology indexes of the two groups were tested before our study and at the end of the 2nd and 4th months with several instruments. Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that taking acetylsalicylic acid orally had significant main effect on high shear blood viscosity and red blood cell deformability index (P√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ä<√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ä0.05), and it also had significant main effect as well as time effect on plasma viscosity (P√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ä<√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ä0.05) and time had significant main effect as well as interaction effect with oral acetylsalicylic acid on low shear blood viscosity and red blood cell aggregation index (P√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ä<√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ä0.05). Repeated measures ANOVA also showed that taking acetylsalicylic acid orally had significant main effect, time effect and interaction effect on infusion speed (P√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ä<√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x81√ä0.01). Oral acetylsalicylic acid could improve hemorheology condition and the infusion speed related to fibrin sheath in the cancer patients.Prevention of pelvic radiation disease. Pelvic cancers are among the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide. Treatment of patients requires a multidisciplinary approach that frequently includes radiotherapy. Gastrointestinal (GI) radiation-induced toxicity is a major complication and the transient or long-term problems, ranging from mild to very severe, arising in non-cancerous tissues resulting from radiation treatment to a tumor of pelvic origin, are actually called as pelvic radiation disease. The incidence of pelvic radiation disease changes according to the radiation technique, the length of follow up, the assessment method, the type and stage of cancer and several other variables. Notably, even with the most recent radiation techniques, i.e., intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the incidence of radiation-induced GI side effects is overall reduced but still not negligible. In addition, radiation-induced GI side effects can develop even after several decades therefore, the improvement of patient life expectancy will unavoidably increase the risk of developing radiation-induced complications. Once developed, the management of pelvic radiation disease may be challenging. Therefore, the prevention of radiation-induced toxicity represents a reasonable way to avoid a dramatic drop of the quality of life of these patients. In the current manuscript we provide an updated and practical review on the best available evidences in the field of the prevention of pelvic radiation disease. Diagnosis of 25 genotypes of human papillomaviruses for their physical statuses in cervical precancerous/cancerous lesions: a comparison of E2/E6E7 ratio-based vs. multiple E1-L1/E6E7 ratio-based detection techniques. Cervical lesions caused by integrated human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are highly dangerous because they can quickly develop into invasive cancers. However, clinicians are currently hampered by the lack of a quick, convenient and precise technique to detect integrated/mixed infections of various genotypes of HPVs in the cervix. This study aimed to develop a practical tool to determine the physical status of different HPVs and evaluate its clinical significance. The target population comprised 1162 women with an HPV infection history of√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°>√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°six months and an abnormal cervical cytological finding. The multiple E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis, a novel technique, was developed based on determining the ratios of E1/E6E7, E2/E6E7, E4E5/E6E7, L2/E6E7 and L1/E6E7 within the viral genome. Any imbalanced ratios indicate integration. Its diagnostic and predictive performances were compared with those of E2/E6E7 ratio analysis. The detection accuracy of both techniques was evaluated using the gold-standard technique detection of integrated papillomavirus sequences (DIPS). To realize a multigenotypic detection goal, a primer and probe library was established. The integration rate of a particular genotype of HPV was correlated with its tumorigenic potential and women with higher lesion grades often carried lower viral loads. The E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis achieved 92.7% sensitivity and 99.0% specificity in detecting HPV integration, while the E2/E6E7 ratio analysis showed a much lower sensitivity (75.6%) and a similar specificity (99.3%). Interference due to episomal copies was observed in both techniques, leading to false-negative results. However, some positive results of E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis were missed by DIPS due to its stochastic detection nature. The E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis is more efficient than E2/E6E7 ratio analysis and DIPS in predicting precancerous/cancerous lesions, in which both positive predictive values (36.7%-82.3%) and negative predictive values (75.9%-100%) were highest (based on the results of three rounds of biopsies). The multiple E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis is more sensitive and predictive than E2/E6E7 ratio analysis as a triage test for detecting HPV integration. It can effectively narrow the range of candidates for colposcopic examination and cervical biopsy, thereby lowering the expense of cervical cancer prevention.Detection and Mapping of DNA Methylation with 2D Material Nanopores. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involving the addition of a methyl group to DNA, which is heavily involved in gene expression and regulation, thereby critical to the progression of diseases such as cancer. In this work we show that detection and localization of DNA methylation can be achieved with nanopore sensors made of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and molybdenum di-sulphide (MoS2). We label each DNA methylation site with a methyl-CpG binding domain protein (MBD1), and combine molecular dynamics simulations with electronic transport calculations to investigate the translocation of the methylated DNA-MBD1 complex through 2D material nanopores under external voltage biases. The passage of the MBD1-labeled methylation site through the pore is identified by dips in the current blockade induced by the DNA strand, as well as by peaks in the transverse electronic sheet current across the 2D layer. The position of the methylation sites can be clearly recognized by the relative positions of the dips in the recorded ionic current blockade with an estimated error ranging from 0% to 16%. Finally, we define the spatial resolution of the 2D material nanopore device as the minimal distance between two methylation sites identified within a single measurement, which is 15 base pairs by ionic current recognition, but as low as 10 base pairs by transverse electronic conductance detection, indicating better resolution with this latter technique. The present approach opens a new route for precise and efficient profiling of DNA methylation.Partition of protein and DNA during cytokinesis in human breast cancer cell lines. Three human breast cancer cell lines (HTB-126, MDA-231, and HTB-122) with DNA index (DI) values between 1.26 and 1.72 were analysed together with a diploid mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line (PCC3) by a TV-video time-lapse technique (pedigree analysis). Cytochemical parameters (DNA and proteins) were studied in individual cells in a rapid scanning microspectrophotometer. Post-mitotic sister cell pairs were analysed after Feulgen-naphthol-yellow staining. The DI values of the cell lines were selected to reflect various well-known clinical ploidy entities differing in malignancy potentials. A mitotic disturbance of the partition of DNA and protein to daughter cells was found in particular in MDA-231 closest to the triploid DNA modal value (DI = 1.37). Duration of mitosis was considerably longer in the near triploid line compared to the other lines. The MDA-231 line was also least sensitive to suboptimal growth conditions. This report calls attention to a possible causality between mitotic error and intraclonal genotype and cell mass heterogeneity.Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in human cancer cell lines is increased by hypoxia. Malignant neoplasms commonly have increased rates of glucose utilization, poor perfusion and areas of low oxygenation. Autoradiographic studies of excised tumors have shown increased FDG uptake in viable cells near necrotic portions of tumor. We evaluated in vitro whether tumor cell FDG uptake increased with hypoxia. The uptake of 3H-FDG into two human tumor cell lines (HTB 63 melanoma and HTB 77 IP3 ovarian carcinoma) was determined after exposure to differing oxygen atmospheres ranging from 0% to 20% O2 for varying time periods. Glucose transport was independently determined as well as estimates of the level of Glut-1 glucose transporter membrane protein. FDG uptake in both the melanoma and the ovarian carcinoma cell lines increased significantly (39.6% +/- 6.7% and 36.7% +/- 9%, respectively) over basal (20% O2) conditions when cells were exposed to a mild hypoxic environment (5% O2) for 1.5 hr. With a 4-hr exposure to 1.5% O2, the increase in FDG uptake was greater at 52.3% +/- 8.9% and 43.5% +/- 19%, respectively. With 4 hr of anoxia, the increase in FDG uptake over basal conditions was 42.7% +/- 10% and 63.3% +/- 13.7% for melanoma and ovarian carcinoma cells, respectively. Membrane transport of 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG) was increased by hypoxia for melanoma and ovarian carcinoma. Immunochemical assays for Glut-1 showed an increase in the membrane expression of the Glut-1 transporter in cells exposed to hypoxia. Hypoxia increases cellular uptake of FDG in two different malignant human cell lines. Increased glucose transport, in part due to increased membrane expression of the Glut-1 glucose transporter, contributes to this phenomenon. Increased FDG uptake in tumors visualized during PET imaging may be partly reflective of tumor hypoxia.Development of sustained delivery system as a novel technique for tissue culture. One of the greatest advances for biomedical research has been the use of tissue culture to study the effects and the mode of action of various organic compounds. However, there are myriad problems associated with the classical approach to pharmaceutical studies in tissue culture, such as contamination, the logistical problems inherent in intermittent dosing, and near-lethal drug doses required to achieve effective physiological doses. This has given impetus to a search for better means of effective delivery routes in a tissue culture setting. The specific objectives of this investigation were: (1) to develop a ceramic delivery system for the novel purpose of releasing sustained levels of the anti-cancer drug combination inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) + inositol (I) in a tissue culture setting (2) to assess the proliferation rate and viability of HTB 122 Intraductile Breast Cancer (IBC) cells exposed to sustained levels of IP6 + I compared to conventional means of drug delivery (dissolved in media) (3) to evaluate the morphological changes associated with this treatment process. Sterile aseptic techniques were employed during the entire study (72 hours of incubation). Data obtained from this investigation suggests the following: (1) TCPL delivery system can be utilized in the tissue culture setting to deliver IP6 + I in a sustained manner for 72 hours (2) the use of IP6 + I at the physiological dose did not induce any significant change in the biochemical marker (MDA) (3) morphological evaluation of cells treated with sustained delivery resulted in cellular atrophy, as well as fragmentation, compared to the treatment by conventional means and to the sham group (empty capsule) and (4) regardless of route of administration, treatment with IP6 + I resulted in a decrease in total protein content compared to the sham capsules and control groups. In conclusion, this approach is a novel use of ceramic delivery systems in tissue culture that gives breakthrough information for basic research on limiting and eliminating contamination and the logistical problems associated with intermittent dosing in tissue culture.Magnetic resonance imaging with hyperpolarized agents: methods and applications. In the past decade, hyperpolarized (HP) contrast agents have been under active development for MRI applications to address the twin challenges of functional and quantitative imaging. Both HP helium (3He) and xenon (129Xe) gases have reached the stage where they are under study in clinical research. HP 129Xe, in particular, is poised for larger scale clinical research to investigate asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and fibrotic lung diseases. With advances in polarizer technology and unique capabilities for imaging of 129Xe gas exchange into lung tissue and blood, HP 129Xe MRI is attracting new attention. In parallel, HP 13C and 15N MRI methods have steadily advanced in a wide range of pre-clinical research applications for imaging metabolism in various cancers and cardiac disease. The HP [1-13C] pyruvate MRI technique, in particular, has undergone phase I trials in prostate cancer and is poised for investigational new drug trials at multiple institutions in cancer and cardiac applications. This review treats the methodology behind both HP gases and HP 13C and 15N liquid state agents. Gas and liquid phase HP agents share similar technologies for achieving non-equilibrium polarization outside the field of the MRI scanner, strategies for image data acquisition, and translational challenges in moving from pre-clinical to clinical research. To cover the wide array of methods and applications, this review is organized by numerical section into (1) a brief introduction, (2) the physical and biological properties of the most common polarized agents with a brief summary of applications and methods of polarization, (3) methods for image acquisition and reconstruction specific to improving data acquisition efficiency for HP MRI, (4) the main physical properties that enable unique measures of physiology or metabolic pathways, followed by a more detailed review of the literature describing the use of HP agents to study: (5) metabolic pathways in cancer and cardiac disease and (6) lung function in both pre-clinical and clinical research studies, concluding with (7) some future directions and challenges, and (8) an overall summary.Minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer. Initial follow-up. An analysis was performed to evaluate early patterns of recurrence and survival in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for primary colorectal cancer. Thirty-nine patients are available with a minimum of 24 months postoperative follow-up. The techniques and expected surgical outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopically assisted colectomies are slowly being defined as these procedures become more common and more widely available. One of the areas of greatest concern is the use of laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for the surgical treatment of patients with primary colorectal cancer. There are anecdotal reports in the literature describing both port site recurrence and wound recurrence in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for colorectal cancer. This raises concerns about whether these recurrences are more common in patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures and whether overall survival is compromised. Wound recurrences and laparoscopic port site recurrences have been described with numerous other intra-abdominal tumors, but the precise incidence remains unknown. The authors reviewed data from 39 patients to determine early patterns of recurrence and overall survival. Two-hundred thirty-eight laparoscopic-assisted colectomies were performed by the Norfolk Surgical Group between June 1992 and September 1995. Thirty-nine of the patients who underwent resection for colorectal cancer between June 1992 and September 1993 currently are available for at least a 2-year follow-up. Preoperative evaluation included physical examination, liver function studies, carcinoembryonic antigen, chest x-ray, computed tomography scans, and endoscopies with biopsy. Postoperative follow-up data consisted of physical examination, liver function tests, CEA, chest X-ray, computed tomography scan of the abdomen, and endoscopy of the colon. No patients have been lost to follow-up. Survival rates and patterns of recurrence were compared between node-negative and node-positive patients and compared with conventional data after open surgery. There were 22 men and 17 women ranging in age from 33 to 89 years. Mean follow-up was 30 months, with a range of 24 to 40 months. There were three patients with recurrence and nine deaths. Recurrence and tumor-related death rates, respectively, for each Dukes\\' stage were 0/1 and 0/1 for stage A, 0/7 and 0/7 for stage B-1, 1/16 and 2/16 for stage B-2, 0/1 and 0/1 for stage C-1, and 2/8 and 1/8 for Stage C-2. All six patients with Dukes\\' stage D disease died of metastatic colorectal cancer within 4 to 14 months of surgery. There were two patients with anastomotic recurrence. No unusual patterns of recurrent disease were noted, and there were no wound or port site recurrences. In this group of patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for primary colorectal malignancy, no adverse patterns of recurrence or decreased survival has been noted at 2-year follow-up when compared with standard open colorectal cancer surgery statistics. Prospective randomized studies with long-term follow-up will be required to better define the potential benefits and adverse effects of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal malignancy.A systematic approach toward the analysis of drug-DNA interactions using Raman spectroscopy: the binding of metal-free bleomycins A(2) and B(2) to calf thymus DNA. Bleomycins A(2) and B(2) are the two active components in the antineoplastic drug Blenoxane. DNA is targeted by this drug in cancer cells and the mode of action of this drug involves DNA. Ambiguity exists as to the way in which bleomycin binds to DNA. Raman spectroscopy was used to examine both calf thymus DNA and a bleomycin/DNA complex at two temperatures. A curvefitting technique was applied to these spectra for a spectral region obscured by many overlapping bands associated with the nucleotide bases in order to derive information about frequencies, bandwidths, and intensities of the vibrational modes in this region. This allowed identification and analysis of bands associated with specific assigned nucleotide base residues. Upon binding of bleomycin, several significant changes in bandwidth, intensities, and frequencies relative to uncomplexed DNA were observed consistently at both higher (30 degrees C) and lower (19 degrees C) temperature. The data presented here support at least a partial mode bleomycin that is temperature dependent and more pronounced at the more physiologically relevant temperature of 30 degrees C.A high performance liquid chromatography system for quantification of hydroxyl radical formation by determination of dihydroxy benzoic acids. The hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase enzyme system is known to produce the superoxide ion and hydrogen peroxide during the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine via xanthine to uric acid. When chelated iron is included in this system, superoxide reduces iron (III) to iron(II) and the iron(II)-chelate further reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Because of the limitations of colourimetric and spectrophotometric techniques by which, to date, the mechanisms of hydroxyl radical formation in the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system have been monitored, a high performance liquid chromatography method utilizing the ion-pair reagent tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and salicylic acid as an aromatic probe for quantification of hydroxyl radical formation was set up. In the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system the major products of hydroxyl radical attack on salicylic acid were 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid and 2,3-dihydroxy benzoic acid in the approximate ratio of 5:1. That the hydroxyl radical is involved in the hydroxylation of salicylic acid in this system was demonstrated by the potency especially of dimethyl sulphoxide, butanol and ethanol as scavengers. Phytic acid, which is considered to be an important protective dietary constituent against colorectal cancer, inhibited hydroxylation of salicylic acid at a concentration one order of magnitude lower than the classical scavengers, but was only effective in the absence of EDTA. The method has been applied to the study of free radical generation in faeces, and preliminary results indicate that the faecal flora are able to produce reactive oxygen species in abundance.Cutaneous cryosurgery. Cutaneous cryosurgery refers to localized application of freezing temperatures to achieve destruction of skin lesions. It can be used to treat a broad range of benign and premalignant skin conditions, and certain malignant skin conditions, with high cure rates. Cellular destruction is accomplished by delivery of the cryogen via dipstick, probe, or spray techniques. It is widely used in primary care because of its safety, effectiveness, low cost, ease of use, good cosmetic results, and lack of need for anesthesia. Cryosurgery is as effective as alternative therapies for most cases of molluscum contagiosum, dermatofibromas, keloids, and plantar or genital warts. It is a more effective cure for common warts than salicylic acid or observation. Cryosurgery is generally the treatment of choice for actinic keratosis. Contraindications to cryosurgery include cryofibrinogenemia, cryoglobulinemia, Raynaud disease, agammaglobulinemia, and multiple myeloma. Complications from cryosurgery include hypopigmentation and alopecia, and can be avoided by limiting freeze times to less than 30 seconds. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or for treatment of skin cancer, which requires larger amounts of tissue destruction, resulting in higher complication rates.Cross-linked, biodegradable, cytocompatible salicylic acid based polyesters for localized, sustained delivery of salicylic acid: an in vitro study. In order to suppress chronic inflammation while supporting cell proliferation, there has been a continuous surge toward development of polymers with the intention of delivering anti-inflammatory molecules in a sustained manner. In the above backdrop, we report the synthesis of a novel, stable, cross-linked polyester with salicylic acid (SA) incorporated in the polymeric backbone and propose a simple synthesis route by melt condensation. The as-synthesized polymer was hydrophobic with a glass transition temperature of 1 √å√¢√•¬°C, which increases to 17 √å√¢√•¬°C upon curing. The combination of NMR and FT-IR spectral techniques established the ester linkages in the as-synthesized SA-based polyester. The pH-dependent degradation rate and the rate of release of salicylic acid from the as-synthesized SA-based polymer were studied at physiological conditions in vitro. The polyester underwent surface erosion and exhibited linear degradation kinetics in which a change in degradation rate is observed after 4-10 days and 24% mass loss was recorded after 4 months at 37 √å√¢√•¬°C and pH 7.4. The delivery of salicylic acid also showed a similar change in slopes, with a sustained release rate of 3.5% in 4 months. The cytocompatibility studies of these polyesters were carried out with C2C12 murine myoblast cells using techniques like MTT assay and flow cytometry. Our results strongly suggest that SA-based polyester supports cell proliferation for 3 days in culture and do not cause cell death (<7%), as quantified by propidium iodide (PI) stained cells. Hence, these polyesters can be used as implant materials for localized, sustained delivery of salicylic acid and have applications in adjuvant cancer therapy, chronic wound healing, and as an alternative to commercially available polymers like poly(lactic acid) and poly(glycolic acid) or their copolymers.Treatment of advanced solid tumors with NSAIDs: Correlation of quantitative monitoring of circulating tumor cells and positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging. The detection and characterisation of tumor-derived circulating epithelial tumor cells (CETCs) or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been a main focus of basic oncological research over previous years. Numerous studies in the past decade have shown that CTCs are a promising tool for the estimation of the risk for metastatic relapse. The present observational study describes treatment results using tumor imaging and the quantification of CTCs. A group of 14 patients with advanced carcinomas was followed during their anticancer treatments. CTC numbers were serially detected and treatment success was estimated by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. A connection was found between tumor remission and a decreasing CTC count in 83%, a connection between stable disease and stable CTC numbers in 78% and a connection between progressive disease (PD) and an increase in CTC count in 50% of cases. In the patients with PD, an incomplete response was observed affecting the CTCs, but not the solid region of the tumor. As a result of this study, it may be concluded that patients with solid tumors benefit from serial quantification of CTCs in addition to imaging, as this combination of techniques provides a more sensitive result than imaging aloneTobacco use, occupation, coffee, various nutrients, and bladder cancer. In a Canadian population-based case-control study of 480 males and 152 female case-control pairs, the relative risk for development of bladder cancer for ever used versus never used cigarettes was 3.9 for males and 2.4 for females, with a dose-response relationship in both sexes. A reduced risk was associated with the use of filter cigarettes compared to nonfilter cigarettes. After control for cigarette usage, a significant risk was noted for male pipe smokers. For male ex-smokers the risk after 15 years of no smoking was less than one-half that of current male smokers. Bladder cancer risk was found for workers in the chemical, rubber, photographic, petroleum, medical, and food processing industries among males and for workers occupationally exposed to dust or fumes among both sexes. Bladder cancer risk was elevated for males consuming all types of coffee, regular coffee, and instant coffee and for females consuming instant coffee, but no dose-response relationship was found. Risk was found for males consuming water from nonpublic supples but not for females. No risk was observed in males or females consuming nitrate-containing foods, beverages other than coffee, or fiddlehead greens. Hair dye usage in females and phenacetin usage in males and females carried no risk. Divergent findings by area for aspirin suggested that an overall association was not causal. Reevaluation of the data on artificial sweeteners confirmed a significant bladder cancer risk in males and a dose-response relationship. The cumulated population attributable risk for bladder cancer was 90% for males from cigarette smoking, industrial exposure, and exposure to nonpublic water supplies and 29% for females from cigarette smoking, industrial exposure, and instant coffee consumption.Testing a New Anticoagulation Method for Free Flap Reconstruction of Head and Neck Cancers. Free flaps are widely used to reconstruct head and neck defects. Despite the improvement in the surgical techniques and the surgeons\\' experiences, flap failures still occur due to thrombotic occlusion after small vessels anastomosis. To reduce the possibility of flap loss as a result of thrombotic occlusion, various anticoagulants have been used. In this study we decided to evaluate a new protocol for anticoagulation therapy and its effect on flap survival and complications. In this interventional study, 30 patients with head and neck cancer underwent surgical defects were reconstructed by microvascular free flap between 2013 and 2014. In the postoperative period patients have taken aspirin (100 mg/day) for 5 days and enoxaparin (40 mg/day subcutaneously) for 3 days. The flap survival was followed for three weeks. Given that there was no complete necrosis or loss of flap, the free flap success rate was as much as 100%. The need for re-exploration occurred in 3 patients (10%). Only in one patient the need for re-exploration was due to problem in venous blood flow. The aspirin-enoxaparin short-term protocol may be a good choice after free flap transfer in reconstruction of head and neck surgical defects.A Review of Patents on Therapeutic Potential and Delivery of Hydroge n Sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with a characteristic smell of rotten eggs. Once only thought of as a toxic gas, evidence now shows that H2S plays major roles in pathological and physiological activities. These roles are being utilized to treat diseases and disorders ranging from hypertension, inflammation, edema, cardiovascular issues, chronic pain, cancer, and many more. Challenges facing the use of H2S currently involve achieving the optimum therapeutic concentrations, synthesizing chemically and physiologically stable donors, and developing clinically appropriate delivery systems. We did an extensive literature search on therapeutic potentials and related issues of H2S which were presented in a systematic flow pattern in introduction. Patents accepted/filed on various aspects of hydrogen sulfide were searched using the United States Patent and Trademark Office database at http://patft.uspto.gov/ and google patents at https://patents.google.com/. The important search terms combined with H2S were therapeutic effect, pharmacological action, biochemistry, measurement, and delivery. We also incorporated our own experiences and publications while discussing the delivery approaches and associated challenges. In the process, researchers have discovered novel techniques in preparing the noxious gas by discovering and synthesizing H2S donors and developing controlled and predictable delivery systems. Donors utilized thus far include derivatives of anti-inflammatory drugs like H2S -aspirin, Allium sativum extracts, inorganic salts, phosphorodithioate derivatives, and thioaminoacid derivatives. Use of controlled delivery systems for H2S is critical to maintain its physiological stability, optimum therapeutic window, increase patient compliance, and make it easier to manufacture and administer. Numerous patents overcoming the challenges of using H2S therapeutically with various donors and delivery mechanisms have been reviewed. The scientific knowledge gained from the last decade researches has moved H2S from a foul smelling pungent gas to the status of a gasotransmitter with many potential therapeutic applications. However, developing a suitable donor and a delivery system using that donor for providing precise and sustained release of H2S for an extended period, is critically needed for any further development towards its translation into clinical practices.Identification of low oxygen-tolerating bacteria in prostate secretions of cancer patients and discussion of possible aetiological significance. The microaerophylic organism Propionibacterium acnes has shown consistent association with prostate cancer (PC). Studies linking circumcision with reduced PC further support anaerobes involvement as circumcision reduces anaerobe colonisation on the glans penis. A 1988 study linked anaerobes with PC but considered them as opportunists in necrotic tumor. A hypothesis that a Helicobacter-like process causes PC justified this pilot study. Active surveillance patients were enrolled. Post-prostate massage urine samples were screened using the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) technique for bacterial identification after culture in anaerobic and aerobic conditions. 8 out√å√¢√•√äof 18 patients (41%) had either obligate anaerobic (n√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°=√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°5) or microaerophilic (n√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°=√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°4, one of whom also had anaerobes) organisms identified. None of 10 control samples contained obligate anaerobes. Although mean PSA was 63% higher in those with low oxygen tolerating bacteria, two high outliers resulted in this difference being non-significant. Given the substantially higher proportion of PC patients with organisms growing in a low concentration of oxygen when combined with previous studies compared to controls, the degree of significance was as high as smoking 5-9 cigarettes a day and needs further investigation. Translational research in trials combining Vitamin D and aspirin have begun as part of such investigation.Flavonoids: not just for cancer anymore. Increasingly, veterinary clients are using nutraceuticals as adjuvant treatment for a variety of ailments in their pets. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of clients who have companion animals with cancer are using a nutraceutical and/or supplement as part of the treatment plan, and 65% of these clients say their veterinarian approves. This trend does not extend to healthy pets, of which only 10% receive routine supplements. Unfortunately, few resources regarding the safety of nutraceutical use exist, and recent evidence has shown that doses of human-formulated supplements such as lipoic acid can be toxic to cats. Veterinarians need a better understanding of the metabolism and safe upper limits for commonly used nutraceuticals because many clients are giving these products to their pets, often in human formulations. This article focuses primarily on two flavonoids: epigallocathechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), a flavanol, and genistein, an isoflavone.On the affinity and specificity of quercetin for DNA. The potential of quercetin (QUE), being a member of the whole family of structurally different flavonoids, to serve as an anti-tumor agent has been recognized, but not fully understood. The interactions between DNA and a series of the flavonoids have so far been mainly investigated using a variety of experimental techniques. Herein, the specificity of QUE for DNA is explored using sophisticated density functional theory (DFT) methods employed to generate the optimized structure of QUE in complex with adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and cytosine (C), respectively. As far as a preference of QUE is concerned, structural and energetic as well as NMR chemical shift arguments clearly indicate a highest for G and a lowest for C. This observation is further substantiated by analyzing the binding modes of QUE docked in a quadruplex receptor structure of DNA and in a duplex receptor structure of DNA. Among all possible single point mutations of the DNA quadruplex and duplex residues, several critical ones causing a conspicuous stabilizing effect on the original complexes of QUE with the DNA receptors are identified. Consequently, several fundamental standpoints shedding new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between QUE and DNA are discussed.STUDIES ON A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT METHOD FOR LARGE-SCALE PREPARATION OF GENKWANIN FROM DAPHNE GENKWA SIEB. ET ZUCC. USING NORMAL-PHASE FLASH CHROMATOGRAPHY. Genkwanin, a flavonoid which has anti-oxidant and anti-tumor activities, was isolated and purified from flowers of Daphne genkwa Sieb. et Zucc. in a large-scale by normal-phase flash chromatography (NPFC). Dried flower buds were extracted with methanol at room temperature and concentrated. The residues were suspended in water and first extracted with petroleum ether, and then chloroform. Genkwanin was concentrated in the chloroform and insoluble fractions. Under the target-guidance of thin layer chromatography (TLC) as well as solubility, a solvent system composed of cyclohexane-acetone (22:3, v/v) was selected. At a flow rate of 30 mL/min,the insoluble and chloroform fractions were separated to yield 1.5 g and 1.35 g of genkwanin with high purities of 98.3% and 98.6% by HPLC analysis, respectively. The chemical structure of the compound was identified by ESI-MS and NMR. Results of the present study indicated that NPFC was a large preparative-scale, speedy and simple process separation technology and it was feasible to find the appropriate proportion of solvent system by transformation from TLC condition.Transnasal PEG tube placement in patients with head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer (HNCa) patients have an increased risk of malnutrition and dysphagia because of their malignancy and the adverse events of therapy. Most of these patients require gastrostomies. Four percent to 7% of HNCa patients are unable to undergo per oral percutaneous gastrostomies. Transnasal endoscopy is an option for gastrostomy placement in selected patients. Clinical, epidemiologic characteristics and outcomes of transnasal PEG (t-PEG) placement. Retrospective analysis. Tertiary care hospital, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. All patients who underwent t-PEG placement. Epidemiology, adverse events, and outcomes of t-PEG placement. Sixteen patients underwent t-PEG placement from January 2010 to May 2013. All patients had HNCa and 56.3% had metastasis. Indications for the transnasal approach were airway compromise, malignant oropharyngeal obstruction, and trismus, among others. All procedures were successful using a 20F gastrostomy tube, push technique, anesthesiologist-guided propofol sedation, and/or nasotracheal intubation. Of all patients, 68.8% were white and 68.8% were men. Mean age was 54 years, and mean body mass index was 20.87. Two patients had a total of 2 adverse events: poor wound healing and wound site infection. Of all patients, 18.75% had leukopenia, 6.25% neutropenia, and 50% lymphopenia. Mean white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count were 8.6 √å√Ñ\\x89√õ√ì 10(9)/L, 6.57 √å√Ñ\\x89√õ√ì 10(9)/L, and .93 √å√Ñ\\x89√õ√ì 10(9)/L, respectively. Eleven patients were alive, 2 were lost to follow-up, and 3 had died at the time of review. Retrospective analysis, small cohort, patient selection bias. t-PEG placement is a viable and safe option for HNCa patients when the standard endoscopic approach is not feasible.Awake craniotomy for tumor resection. Surgical treatment of brain tumors, especially those located in the eloquent areas such as anterior temporal, frontal lobes, language, memory areas, and near the motor cortex causes high risk of eloquent impairment. Awake craniotomy displays major rule for maximum resection of the tumor with minimum functional impairment of the Central Nervous System. These case reports discuss the use of awake craniotomy during the brain surgery in Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. A 56-year-old woman with left-sided body hypoesthesia since last 3 months and a 25-year-old with severe headache of 1 month duration were operated under craniotomy for brain tumors resection. An awake craniotomy was planned to allow maximum tumor intraoperative testing for resection and neurologic morbidity avoidance. The method of anesthesia should offer sufficient analgesia, hemodynamic stability, sedation, respiratory function, and also awake and cooperative patient for different neurological test. Airway management is the most important part of anesthesia during awake craniotomy. Tumor surgery with awake craniotomy is a safe technique that allows maximal resection of lesions in close relationship to eloquent cortex and has a low risk of neurological deficit. Nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery using regional anesthesia and vagal block and targeted sedation. Thoracoscopic surgery without endotracheal intubation is a novel technique for diagnosis and treatment of thoracic diseases. This study reported the experience of nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan. From August 2009 through August 2013, 446 consecutive patients with lung or pleural diseases were treated by nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery. Regional anesthesia was achieved by thoracic epidural anesthesia or internal intercostal blockade. Targeted sedation was performed with propofol infusion to achieve a bispectral index value between 40 and 60. The demographic data and clinical outcomes were evaluated by retrospective chart review. Thoracic epidural anesthesia was used in 290 patients (65.0%) while internal intercostal blockade was used in 156 patients (35.0%). The final diagnosis were primary lung cancer in 263 patients (59.0%), metastatic lung cancer in 38 (8.5%), benign lung tumor in 140 (31.4%), and pneumothorax in 5 (1.1%). The median anesthetic induction time was 30 minutes by thoracic epidural anesthesia and was 10 minutes by internal intercostal blockade. The operative procedures included lobectomy in 189 patients (42.4%), wedge resection in 229 (51.3%), and segmentectomy in 28 (6.3%). Sixteen patients (3.6%) required conversion to tracheal intubation because of significant mediastinal movement (seven patients), persistent hypoxemia (two patients), dense pleural adhesions (two patients), ineffective epidural anesthesia (two patients), bleeding (two patients), and tachypnea (one patient). One patient (0.4%) was converted to thoracotomy because of bleeding. No mortality was noted in our patients. Nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery is technically feasible and safe and can be a less invasive alternative for diagnosis and treatment of thoracic diseases.Anesthesia for awake craniotomy: case report. Some intracranial procedures are achievable with patients awake, however, there are challenges ranging from patient compliance to homeostasis. The aim of this study is to present a case of intracranial surgery for removal of a tumor in the left parietal lobe with the patient awake during the procedure. After patient selection and psychological preparation, the proposed excision of the left parietal lobe lesion in the waking state was clarified and accepted. Continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil was administered to maintain a Ramsay score of 2-3. The bilateral scalp blockade was performed with ropivacaine. The Mayfield head fixation device was installed and drapes adjusted to maintain the airway and eyes accessible for mapping with electrical stimulation and tumor excision. For dura mater incision, a pad with 2% lidocaine was applied for 3 minutes. The surgery was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the seventh day of hospitalization without presenting complication. Although the maintenance of analgesia and hemodynamic stability was a challenge with the patient awake, the target-controlled infusion of propofol provided the desired level of consciousness, remifentanil titrated analgesia and sedation without drug accumulation, and the blockade with ropivacaine provided satisfactory analgesia. We conclude that the anesthetic technique was satisfactory for our patient.Anaesthetics and analgesics neurocognitive effects, organ protection and cancer reoccurrence an update. Available general and local anaesthetics, third generation inhaled anaesthetics, propofol and amide class local anaesthetics are effective and reassuringly safe. They are all associated to low incidence of toxicology and or adverse-effects. There is however a debate whether anaesthetic drug and technique could exhibit effects beyond the primary effects fully reversible depression of the central nervous system, dose dependent anaesthesia. Anaesthetics may be involved in the progression of neurocognitive side effects seen especially in the elderly after major surgery, so called Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction. On the other hand anaesthetics may exhibit organ protective potential, reducing ischemia reperfusion injury and improving survival after cardiac surgery. Anaesthetics and anaesthetic technique may also have effects of cancer reoccurrence and risk for metastasis. The present paper provides an update around the evidence base around anaesthesia potential contributing effect on the occurrence of postoperative cognitive adverse-effects, organ protective properties and influence on cancer re-occurrence/metastasis.Anesthetic technique and cancer recurrence in oncologic surgery: unraveling the puzzle. Surgery/anesthetic technique-stimulated immunosuppression in the perioperative period might cause an increase in cancer-related mortality. Whether anesthetic technique can affect the outcomes of cancer patients remains inconclusive. This review discusses data from the available literature on anesthetic techniques applied in oncologic surgery, the long-term outcomes of anesthetic technique, and their relation to survival and cancer recurrence. Searches of the PubMed database up to June 30, 2016, were conducted to identify publications with the terms anesthetic technique and cancer recurrence, regional anesthesia and cancer recurrence, local anesthesia and cancer recurrence, anesthetic technique and immunosuppression, and anesthetic technique and oncologic surgery. Surgery/anesthesia-stimulated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) provides immunosuppression through several soluble factors. Volatile anesthetics and opioids suppress cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and promote the proliferation of cancer cells and angiogenesis, whereas propofol does not suppress CMI and inhibits tumor angiogenesis. Regional anesthesia (RA) protects CMI and diminishes the surgical neuroendocrine stress response by blocking afferent neural transmission that stimulates the HPA axis and SNS, decreasing the requirement for opioids and volatile anesthetics and thereby decreasing cancer recurrence. Preclinical and retrospective studies highlight a potential benefit of anesthetic technique in reducing cancer-related mortality and recurrence by attenuating immunosuppression following surgical treatment in patients with specific types of cancer. Several well-planned, prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are underway that may provide more conclusive and definitive results regarding the benefits of anesthetic technique on survival in oncologic surgery.Perioperative Anesthesia Care and Tumor Progression. This narrative review discusses the most recent up-to-date findings focused on the currently available best clinical practice regarding perioperative anesthesia care bundle factors and their effect on tumor progression. The main objective is to critically appraise the current literature on local anesthetics, regional outcome studies, opioids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and their ability to decrease recurrence in patients undergoing cancer surgery. A brief discussion of additional topical perioperative factors relevant to the anesthesiologist including volatile and intravenous anesthetics, perioperative stress and anxiety, nutrition, and immune stimulation is included. The results of several recently published systematic reviews looking at the association between cancer recurrences and regional anesthesia have yielded inconclusive data and provide insufficient evidence regarding a definitive benefit of regional anesthesia. Basic science data suggests an anti tumor effect induced by local anesthetics. New refined animal models show that opioids can safely be used for perioperative pain management. Preliminary evidence suggests that NSAIDs should be an essential part of multimodal analgesia. Volatile anesthetics have been shown to increase tumor formation, whereas preclinical and emerging clinical data from propofol indicate tumor protective qualities. The perioperative period in the cancer patient represents a unique environment where surgically mediated stress response leads to immune suppression. Regional anesthesia techniques when indicated in combination with multimodal analgesia that include NSAIDs, opioids, and local anesthetics to prevent the pathophysiologic effects of pain and neuroendocrine stress response should be viewed as an essential part of balanced anesthesia.Manual Trans-Tracheal High Frequency Positive Pressure Ventilation for Left Main Bronchus and Carinal Mass Surgical Resection in a Child. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), also called pseudo-tumor, is a very rare condition and accounts for less than 1% of primary lung tumor. It is most common benign tumor of lung in children. This case is reported with the objective of highlighting the role of manual trans-tracheal high frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV) in facilitating surgical resection with maintenance of adequate oxygenation and a little compromised ventilation. A9-year boy, weighing 21 kg, was diagnosed as a case of IMTof left main bronchus on biopsy and was successfully treated by surgical excision through left thoracotomy. HFPPV through improvised technique was used for ventilation and oxygenation during surgery. Total Intravenous anaesthesia with propofol infusion and increments of fentanyl was used during HFPPV. After the completion of the surgery, conventional positive pressure ventilation (PPV) was continued through the endotracheal tube (ETT) to check any bronchial stump leak. After the surgery, patient was weaned and extubated in the operating room. Hospital course remained uneventful and the patient was discharged after 6 days. HFPPV with manually improvised technique is applicable in carinal surgery for optimization of oxygenation, ventilation, and uninterrupted surgical resection.Use of a job-exposure matrix to evaluate parental occupation and childhood cancer. We examined the association between parental occupation and childhood cancer among 252 incident cases of childhood cancer (ages 0-14, diagnosed 1976-83) and 222 controls selected by random digit dialing in Denver, Colorado (USA). A job-exposure matrix was used to assign parental exposures based on job titles, emphasizing chemicals that were implicated in previous studies. All cancers, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and brain cancer were examined in relation to parental occupation during the year prior to the birth of the child. Elevated odds ratios (OR), all with confidence intervals extending below the null, were found for maternal exposure to benzene (OR = 1.9), petroleum/coke pitch/tar (OR = 2.2), and soot (OR = 3.3) in relation to total cancers. The ORs for total cancer and paternal exposure to all hydrocarbons combined was 1.0. Results for individual hydrocarbons and ALL showed larger odds ratios, including aniline (OR = 2.1), benzene (OR = 1.6), and petroleum/coke pitch/tar (OR = 1.6). Potential exposure to creosote was strongly associated with brain cancer (OR = 3.7) based on five exposed cases (95 percent confidence interval = 0.8-16.6). Control for other potential childhood cancer risk factors did not alter the results substantially. In spite of uncertainties due to small numbers and errors in exposure classification, results tend to corroborate past research that suggests an association between specific parental occupational exposures and childhood cancer.Mutagens in contaminated soil: a review. The intentional and accidental discharges of toxic pollutants into the lithosphere results in soil contamination. In some cases (e.g., wood preserving wastes, coal-tar, airborne combustion by-products), the contaminated soil constitutes a genotoxic hazard. This work is a comprehensive review of published information on soil mutagenicity. In total, 1312 assessments of genotoxic activity from 118 works were examined. The majority of the assessments (37.6%) employed the Salmonella mutagenicity test with strains TA98 and/or TA100. An additional 37.6% of the assessments employed a variety of plant species (e.g., Tradescantia clone 4430, Vicia faba, Zea mays, Allium cepa) to assess mutagenic activity. The compiled data on Salmonella mutagenicity indicates significant differences (p<0.0001) in mean potency (revertents per gram dry weight) between industrial, urban, and rural/agricultural sites. Additional analyses showed significant empirical relationships between S9-activated TA98 mutagenicity and soil polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentration (r2=0.19 to 0.25, p<0.0001), and between direct-acting TA98 mutagenicity and soil dinitropyrene (DNP) concentration (r2=0.87, p<0.0001). The plant assay data revealed excellent response ranges and significant differences between heavily contaminated, industrial, rural/agricultural, and reference sites, for the anaphase aberration in Allium cepa (direct soil contact) and the waxy locus mutation assay in Zea mays (direct soil contact). The Tradescantia assays appeared to be less responsive, particularly for exposures to aqueous soil leachates. Additional data analyses showed empirical relationships between anaphase aberrations in Allium, or mutations in Arabidopsis, and the 137Cs contamination of soils. Induction of micronuclei in Tradescantia is significantly related to the soil concentration of several metals (e.g., Sb, Cu, Cr, As, Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn). Review of published remediation exercises showed effective removal of genotoxic petrochemical wastes within one year. Remediation of more refractory genotoxic material (e.g., explosives, creosote) frequently showed increases in mutagenic hazard that remained for extended periods. Despite substantial contamination and mutagenic hazards, the risk of adverse effect (e.g., mutation, cancer) in humans or terrestrial biota is difficult to quantify.Separation procedures for naturally occurring antioxidant phytochemicals. Phytochemicals in fruits, vegetables, spices and traditional herbal medicinal plants have been found to play protective roles against many human chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). These diseases are associated with oxidative stresses caused by excess free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. Antioxidant phytochemicals exert their effect by neutralizing these highly reactive radicals. Among the tens of thousands of phytochemicals found in our diets or traditional medicines, polyphenols and carotenoids stand out as the two most important groups of natural antioxidants. However, although collectively these phytochemicals are good antioxidants, the roles and effect of individual compounds are often not well known. Hundreds of carotenoids and thousands of polyphenols have been identified so far from various plants. A single plant could contain highly complex profiles of these compounds, which sometimes are labile to heat, air and light, and they may exist at very low concentrations in the plants. This makes the separation and detection of these antioxidant phytochemicals a challenging task. The present review focuses on the antioxidant activity, chemical types, sampling and sample processing procedures, and separation using various chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques. Detection and quantification using ultraviolet-visible-diode array and mass spectrometry will be discussed.MHC-B haplotypes impact susceptibility and resistance to RSV-A infection. We investigated the impact of√å√¢√•√ähaplotype√•√äof√•√ämajor histocompatibility complex√•√ä(MHC)-B on the outcome of infection of Synthetic Dam Line (SDL) broiler strain with√•√äRous Sarcoma Virus√å√¢√•√ä(RSV).√å√¢√•√äGenomic√•√äanalysis of√•√äMHC-B√•√ähaplotypes, revealed a total of 12 known standard√•√ähaplotypes√•√äthat constituted to twenty-five different√•√ägenotypes√•√äand one new√•√ähaplotype√•√äof 217 bp size, designated BX. The inoculation of√•√äRSV-A in SDL chicks resulted in the development of√•√ätumors√•√äof progressive or regressive√å√¢√•√äphenotypes√•√äwith varying√•√ätumor profile index√•√ä(TPI).√å√¢√•√äHaplotypes√•√äB2, B21√•√äand B22had low√å√¢√•√äTPI√å√¢√•√äscores (1 or 2) with less√•√ämortality√•√äand were resistant to√å√¢√•√äRSV-A√å√¢√•√ätumor. The√•√ähaplotypes√•√äB13, B13.1., B15, B15.1.√å√¢√•√äand B15.2.√å√¢√•√ähad significantly higher√å√¢√•√äTPI√å√¢√•√äscores (5 or 6), indicating a susceptibility to√•√äRSV-A. The√å√¢√•√ägenotype, Bx√•√ä/Bx, had a mean√•√äTPI√•√äscore of 3.67 √å√¢√•¬± 1.33, which was closer to the resistant√•√ähaplotype.√å√¢√•√äSequence analysis√•√äof the new√•√ähaplotype√•√ä(BX) revealed 99.5% similarity with B2√•√ähaplotype.√•√äMetastases√•√äwas observed in 44% of chicks and comprised of mixed fibrosarcoma and myxosarcoma.Dual TNFalpha-induced effects on NRF2 mediated antioxidant defence in astrocyte-rich cultures: role of protein kinase activation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is a pleiotropic molecule that can have both protective and detrimental effects in neurodegeneration. Here we have investigated the temporal effects of TNFalpha on the inducible Nrf2 system in astrocyte-rich cultures by determination of glutathione (GSH) levels, gammaglutamylcysteine ligase (gammaGCL) activity, the protein levels of Nrf2, Keap1, the catalytic and modulatory subunit of gammaGCL (gammaGCL-C and gammaGCL-M respectively). Astrocyte-rich cultures were exposed for 24 or 72 h to different concentrations of TNFalpha. Acute exposure (24 h) of astrocyte-rich cultures to 10 ng/mL of TNFalpha increased GSH, gammaGCL activity, the protein levels of gammaGCL-M, gammaGCL-C and Nrf2 in parallel with decreased levels of Keap1. Antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-mediated transcription was blocked by inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK and Akt whereas inactivation of p38 and GSK3beta further enhanced transcription. In contrast treatment with TNFalpha for 72 h decreased components of the Nrf2 system in parallel with an increase of Keap1. Stimulation of the Nrf2 system by tBHQ was intact after 24 h but blocked after 72 h treatment with TNFalpha. This down-regulation after 72 h correlated with activation of p38 MAPK and GSK3beta, since inhibition of these signalling pathways reversed this effect. The upregulation of the Nrf2 system by TNFalpha (24 h treatment) protected the cells from oxidative stress through elevated gammaGCL activity whereas the down-regulation (72 h treatment) caused pronounced oxidative toxicity. One of the important implications of the results is that in a situation where Nrf2 is decreased, such as in Alzheimer\\'s disease, the effect of TNFalpha is detrimental.Enrichment and isolation of barbigerone from Millettia pachycarpa Benth. using high-speed counter-current chromatography and preparative HPLC. Enrichment of the anti-tumor compound barbigerone along with a rotenoid derivative from Millettia pachycarpa Benth. was performed by a two-step high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) separation process. In the first step, 155.8 mg of target fraction (Fra6) was obtained from 400 mg ethyl acetate extract of M. pachycarpa Benth. with an increase in barbigerone from 5.1 to 13% via HSCCC using a solvent system of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (5:4:5:3, v/v) under normal phase head to tail elution. HSCCC was repeated to eliminate the major contaminant in this initial fraction 6. After a separation time of 65 min, 22.1 mg barbigerone of 87.7% purity was obtained from Fra6 with the ternary solvent system of n-hexane-methanol-water (2:2:1, v/v) under normal phase elution. Finally, preparative HPLC was employed for the further isolation of barbigerone and the rotenoid derivative. The structures were confirmed by ESI-MS, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR.Economic consequences of HIV/AIDS in India. HIV/AIDS is one of the pressing public health problems in India. Available information indicates a rising trend of infection. The impact of HIV/AIDS on the economic front is important as it affects mainly the young, who are in the reproductive age group. We estimated the cost of productivity losses in a lifetime attributable to HIV-related mortality in India in the population of the year 1991 at current HIV infection rates. The analysis was done from the societal viewpoint, adopting a discount rate of 5%. To estimate the loss in person-years due to HIV/AIDS, two scenarios were considered. Firstly, the population without HIV/AIDS, and secondly, the population with HIV/AIDS. The difference in person-years lived by the cohort in both populations would provide the person-years lost due to HIV/AIDS. To calculate the person-years lived in each, the life table approach was used. The demographic data from the 1991 Census were used. The population was divided into 15 five-year cohorts and the current age-specific death rates were used. Assumptions regarding HIV incidence rates in urban and rural areas in different age groups were made based on the available data and consensus of experts. The estimate was first done for a cohort of 100,000 population for rural and urban areas and then extrapolated to the population in the different age groups. To convert the person-years lost into monetary terms, minimum wages were estimated to be Rs 14,460 per annum. The total undiscounted life-years lost due to HIV/ AIDS by the present population of India will be 238.4 million years-123.7 million years for urban and 114.7 million years for rural areas. On an average this is 0.4 years lost per person. The life-years lost per case of HIV was 44.4 years. Assuming minimum wages of Rs 14460 as the value of one year, the total economic loss is Rs 3447 billion. The productivity loss per case is Rs 642,024 (US$ 20,710). For an estimated national per capita income of Rs 4252.4 the total economic loss is Rs 1014 billion. If a discount rate of 5% is applied for future losses then the total potential years of life lost will be 23 million-11.3 million for urban and 11.7 million for rural areas. In monetary terms this will be Rs 332.6 billion by minimum wages assumption, and 97.8 billion if the national per capita income is assumed to be the cost of one year. HIV/AIDS imposes a significant burden on the economic front. The productivity losses are likely to be an underestimate as the costs of treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, prevention programmes and labour costs have not been taken into account. To decide whether HIV/AIDS needs a high priority int he Indian context, it is necessary to have similar estimates for other important diseases such as tuberculosis and cancer.Colorectal cancer risk, chronic illnesses, operations, and medications: case control results from the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. The associations between colorectal cancer risk and several chronic illnesses, operations, and various medications were examined in 715 colorectal cancer cases and 727 age/sex-matched controls in data derived from a large, comprehensive, population-based study of this cancer conducted in Melbourne, Australia. There was a statistically significant deficit among cases of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, chronic chest disease, and chronic arthritis and a statistically significant excess of hemorrhoids among cases, and all of these differences were consistent for both colon and rectal cancer and for both males and females. Although no statistically significant differences were found for other cancers, there were twice as many breast cancers among cases (16) than among controls and also there were 9 uterine cancers among cases and only 2 among controls. There was a statistically significant deficit among cases in the use of aspirin-containing medication and vitamin supplements, and this was consistent for both colon and rectal cancer and for both males and females. There was a statistically significant excess of large bowel polypectomy among cases. The modeling of these significant associations simultaneously in a logistic regression equation indicated that hypertension, heart disease, chronic arthritis, and aspirin use were each independent effects and consistent for both colon and rectal cancer for both males and females and also that these effects were independent of dietary risk factors previously described in the Melbourne study. The possible relevance of these findings towards an understanding of colorectal cancer risk and etiology is discussed.Racial differences in preventive practices of African-American and Hispanic women. To compare the use of preventive practices of Hispanic- and African-American women aged 50 and older. A cross-sectional survey. Inpatient and outpatient units of a teaching hospital located in South Central Los Angeles. Convenience sample of 337 women aged 50 and older. Demographic and lifestyle characteristics and selected preventive practices. Preventive practices reported were self-breast examination, mammography, Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, digital rectal examination and stool occult blood examination, sigmoidoscopy, chemoprophylaxis, and immunization. Information was obtained in a face-to-face interview. African-American women were more likely to have had a Pap smear ever and to have used aspirin prophylaxis than Hispanic women. There were no major differences in the use of preventive services by the two ethnic groups except for Pap smear and aspirin use. Immunization and colorectal cancer screening rates were low in African-American and Hispanic women.A prospective study of sugar intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in women. To investigate prospectively whether intake of total or type of sugar is associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The contribution of sugar intake to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes has not been settled in the context of primary prevention because of limited prospective data. The Women\\'s Health Study is a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and vitamin E in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. A validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was completed by 39,345 women aged 45 years and older. The main outcome was the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The predictor was sugar intake, including sucrose, glucose, fructose, and lactose. Using Cox proportional hazard models, multivariate RRs of type 2 diabetes for increasing quintiles of sugar intake compared with the lowest quintile were estimated. Compared with the lowest quintile of sugar intake, the RRs and 95% CIs for the highest quintiles were 0.84 (0.67-1.04) for sucrose, 0.96 (0.78-1.19) for fructose, 1.04 (0.85-1.28) for glucose, and 0.99 (0.80-1.22) for lactose, after adjustment for known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Similar findings of no association were obtained in subgroup analyses stratified by BMI. Intake of sugars does not appear to play a deleterious role in primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. These prospective data support the recent American Diabetes Association\\'s guideline that a moderate amount of sugar can be incorporated in a healthy diet.A quantitative illustration of the public health potential of aspirin. Aspirin is showing potential in reducing the risk of several diseases of public health importance. These include cardiovascular disease, cancer and Alzheimer\\'s disease. In this paper, a fictional scenario is considered in which 50 year old individuals are encouraged to take aspirin. Using crude assumptions and simple calculations, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve of aspirin users is presented. The main finding of this exercise is the possibility that the long-term use of low dose aspirin may double the chances of individuals living a healthy life into their 90\\'s. Further research is needed.What role today for Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer?. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/aspirin (NSAIDs) remain today the main etiologies of duodenal (DU) and gastric (GU) ulcers. In some countries or areas in which prevalence of H. pylori infection has decreased, and probably also in which the consumption of NSAIDs is high, the proportion of ulcers not associated with H. pylori is high. Nevertheless, the proportion of Helicobacter pylori-negative, NSAID-negative ulcers remains low, less than 6% in most studies. Furthermore, this proportion is probably overestimated because the search for the infection and NSAIDs treatments was not always performed properly. Data about characteristics of idiopathic GU (after excluding cancer) are missing. In two studies, Helicobacter pylori-negative, NSAID-negative DU were associated in two thirds to three quarters of the cases with co-morbidities, often severe (cirrhosis, respiratory, renal or cardiac failure, malignancy). Numerous digestive diseases can give a DU, Crohn\\'s disease being probably the most frequent one. Gastric acid hypersecretion, as in H. pylori-positive DU, seems to be the pathogenic factor of idiopathic DU, with increased duodenal acid load. The outcome of idiopathic ulcers has been little studied. There are no reliable data concerning the risk of complications. Therapy is based on proton pump inhibitors at a dosage allowing prolonged healingAssociation between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the incidence of lung cancer in the Iowa women\\'s health study. Previous studies have suggested that use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with reduced risk of lung cancer, but the data are inconsistent and are limited particularly with respect to the effects of aspirin, separate from other NSAIDs. The Iowa Women\\'s Health Study is a prospective cohort of 41,836 Iowa women ages 55 to 69 years old at baseline in 1986. NSAID use was assessed in 1992. Over 10 years of follow-up, 403 incident cases of lung cancer were identified. The association of incident lung cancer with current use of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs was analyzed after adjustment for lung cancer risk factors. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using multivariate COX proportional hazards regression. There were 27,162 women in the analytic cohort. After controlling for age, education, alcohol intake, pack-years, smoking status, body mass index, and total fruit intake, the RR of women taking six or more aspirin weekly was 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.59). The HR was 1.23 for women taking six or more non-aspirin NSAIDs weekly (95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.65). There was no statistically significant trend by frequency of use for either aspirin (P(trend) = 0.22) or non-aspirin NSAIDs (P(trend) = 0.53). Analyses by histologic type and smoking status yielded similar null results. Information on dosage and duration of use were not available for this analysis. These findings do not suggest that aspirin or other NSAIDs reduce risk of lung cancer in this cohort of postmenopausal women.A quantitative immunochemical fecal occult blood test for colorectal neoplasia. Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) for colorectal cancer screening are not specific for human hemoglobin and have low sensitivity. Automated-development, immunochemical FOBT is quality-controlled, is specific for human hemoglobin, and does not require diet restriction. To measure the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative immunochemical fecal hemoglobin measurements for detection of cancer and advanced adenoma in patients undergoing colonoscopy, to determine fecal hemoglobin thresholds that give the highest posttest probability for neoplasia, and to determine the number of immunochemical FOBTs needed. Prospective, cross-sectional study. Ambulatory endoscopy services of the main health medical organization in Tel Aviv, Israel. 1000 consecutive ambulatory patients--some asymptomatic but at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia and some symptomatic--who were undergoing elective colonoscopy and volunteered to prepare immunochemical FOBTs. The hemoglobin content of 3 bowel movements was measured, and the highest value was compared with colonoscopy findings. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, and 95% CIs of fecal hemoglobin measurements for clinically significant neoplasia, their relationship to the amount of fecal hemoglobin measured, and the number of immunochemical FOBTs performed. Colonoscopy identified clinically significant neoplasia in 91 patients (cancer in 17 patients and advanced adenomas in 74 patients). Using 3 immunochemical FOBTs and a hemoglobin threshold of 75 ng/mL of buffer, sensitivity and specificity were 94.1% (95% CI, 82.9% to 100.0%) and 87.5% (CI, 85.4% to 89.6%), respectively, for cancer and 67% (CI, 57.4% to 76.7%) and 91.4% (CI, 89.6% to 93.2%), respectively, for any clinically significant neoplasia. The fecal sampling method is standardized, but the sample size depends on fecal consistency. Some patients were tested while discontinuing aspirin and anticoagulant therapies. Study patients were at increased risk, and results might not apply to average-risk populations. Quantitative immunochemical FOBT has good sensitivity and specificity for detection of clinically significant neoplasia. Test performance in screening average-risk populations is not known.Clinical impact of drug-drug interaction between aspirin and prednisolone at a cancer center. Adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events are complications in aspirin and prednisolone cotherapy. The prevalence of adverse GI events would be expected to be increased with cotherapy due to the overlapping toxicities of the 2 drugs. However, there is a dearth of literature investigating how often this interaction causes clinically important adverse GI events. This retrospective study aimed to determine the prevalence of adverse GI events associated with the coadministration of aspirin and prednisolone. The use of gastroprotectant agents was also studied. The medical records of patients with cancer prescribed aspirin and prednisolone therapy between January 2007 and June 2011 were analyzed. The duration of aspirin-prednisolone overlap, prevalence of adverse GI events, and details on the concurrent use of other medications were evaluated. The study included data from 142 patients (male, 64.8% mean [SD] age, 67.4 [11.0] years). A total of 78.9% of the patients were on some form of gastroprotectant, the most common class of which was proton pump inhibitors. The prevalence of adverse GI events was 4.2% (6 patients). Four patients had presented with GI symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysphagia, and vomiting) 3 patients had signs of GI injury (duodenal ulcers, iron deficiency anemia, and a Mallory-Weiss tear). The Naranjo algorithm classified 5 patients experienced possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and 1 as a probable ADR. Our study found that the prevalence of adverse GI events was low and managed to establish a weak association between the occurrence of events and the coadministration of aspirin and prednisolone. This finding, together with the concurrent prescription of gastroprotectants, suggests that the clinical impact of the aspirin and prednisolone DDI is minimal.International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer. √å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ?Guidelines addressing the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients are heterogeneous and their implementation has been suboptimal worldwide. To establish a common international consensus addressing practical, clinically relevant questions in this setting. An international consensus working group of experts was set up to develop guidelines according to an evidence-based medicine approach, using the GRADE system. For the initial treatment of established VTE: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended [1B] fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be also used [2D] thrombolysis may only be considered on a case-by-case basis [Best clinical practice (Guidance)] vena cava filters (VCF) may be considered if contraindication to anticoagulation or pulmonary embolism recurrence under optimal anticoagulation periodic reassessment of contraindications to anticoagulation is recommended and anticoagulation should be resumed when safe VCF are not recommended for primary VTE prophylaxis in cancer patients [Guidance]. For the early maintenance (10 days to 3 months) and long-term (beyond 3 months) treatment of established VTE, LMWH for a minimum of 3 months is preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA) [1A] idraparinux is not recommended [2C] after 3-6 months, LMWH or VKA continuation should be based on individual evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, tolerability, patient preference and cancer activity [Guidance]. For the treatment of VTE recurrence in cancer patients under anticoagulation, three options can be considered: (i) switch from VKA to LMWH when treated with VKA (ii) increase in LMWH dose when treated with LMWH, and (iii) VCF insertion [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in surgical cancer patients, use of LMWH o.d. or low dose of UFH t.i.d. is recommended pharmacological prophylaxis should be started 12-2 h preoperatively and continued for at least 7-10 days there are no data allowing conclusion that one type of LMWH is superior to another [1A] there is no evidence to support fondaparinux as an alternative to LMWH [2C] use of the highest prophylactic dose of LMWH is recommended [1A] extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) after major laparotomy may be indicated in cancer patients with a high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding [2B] the use of LMWH for VTE prevention in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery may be recommended as for laparotomy [Guidance] mechanical methods are not recommended as monotherapy except when pharmacological methods are contraindicated [2C]. For the prophylaxis of VTE in hospitalized medical patients with cancer and reduced mobility, we recommend prophylaxis with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux [1B] for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with l-asparaginase, depending on local policy and patient characteristics, prophylaxis may be considered in some patients [Guidance] in patients receiving chemotherapy, prophylaxis is not recommended routinely [1B] primary pharmacological prophylaxis of VTE may be indicated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic [1B] or lung [2B] cancer treated with chemotherapy and having a low risk of bleeding in patients treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide combined with steroids and/or chemotherapy, VTE prophylaxis is recommended in this setting, VKA at low or therapeutic doses, LMWH at prophylactic doses and low-dose aspirin have shown similar effects however, the efficacy of these regimens remains unclear [2C]. Special situations include brain tumors, severe renal failure (CrCl<30 mL min(-1) ), thrombocytopenia and pregnancy. Guidances are provided in these contexts. Dissemination and implementation of good clinical practice for the management of VTE, the second cause of death in cancer patients, is a major public health priority.Improved survival outcomes with the incidental use of beta-blockers among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy. Preclinical studies have shown that norepinephrine can directly stimulate tumor cell migration and that this effect is mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor. We retrospectively reviewed 722 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received definitive radiotherapy (RT). A Cox proportional hazard model was utilized to determine the association between beta-blocker intake and locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). In univariate analysis, patients taking beta-blockers (n = 155) had improved DMFS (P < 0.01), DFS (P < 0.01), and OS (P = 0.01), but not LRPFS (P = 0.33) compared with patients not taking beta-blockers (n = 567). In multivariate analysis, beta-blocker intake was associated with a significantly better DMFS [hazard ratio (HR), 0.67 P = 0.01], DFS (HR, 0.74 P = 0.02), and OS (HR, 0.78 P = 0.02) with adjustment for age, Karnofsky performance score, stage, histology type, concurrent chemotherapy, radiation dose, gross tumor volume, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the use of aspirin. There was no association of beta-blocker use with LRPFS (HR = 0.91, P = 0.63). Beta-blocker use is associated with improved DMFS, DFS, and OS in this large cohort of NSCLC patients. Future prospective trials can validate these retrospective findings and determine whether the length and timing of beta-blocker use influence survival outcomes.Thyroid cancer risk is not increased in diabetic patients. This study evaluated thyroid cancer risk with regards to diabetes status and diabetes duration, and with the use of anti-diabetic drugs including sulfonylurea, metformin, insulin, acarbose, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, by using a population-based reimbursement database in Taiwan. A random sample of 1,000,000 subjects covered by the National Health Insurance was recruited. After excluding patients with type 1 diabetes, 999730 subjects (495673 men and 504057 women) were recruited into the analyses. Logistic regression estimated the odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for independent variables including age, sex, diabetes status/duration, anti-diabetic drugs, other medications, comorbidities, living regions, occupation and examinations that might potentially lead to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in various models. The diabetic patients had a significantly higher probability of receiving potential detection examinations (6.38% vs. 5.83%, P<0.0001). After multivariable-adjustment, the OR (95% CI) for diabetes status was 0.816 (0.652-1.021) and for diabetes duration <1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years and √å¬¢\\x89√õ¬°√•¬¥ 5 years vs. non-diabetes was 0.071 (0.010-0.507), 0.450 (0.250-0.813), 0.374 (0.203-0.689) and 1.159 (0.914-1.470), respectively. Among the anti-diabetic agents, only sulfonylurea was significantly associated with thyroid cancer, OR (95% CI): 1.882 (1.202-2.947). The OR (95% CI) for insulin, metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone was 1.701 (0.860-3.364), 0.696 (0.419-1.155), 0.581 (0.202-1.674), 0.522 (0.069-3.926) and 0.669 (0.230-1.948), respectively. Furthermore, patients with benign thyroid disease or other cancer, living in Kao-Ping/Eastern regions, or receiving potential detection examinations might have a significantly higher risk and male sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, vascular complications or use of statin, aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might be associated with a significantly lower risk. There is a lack of an overall association between diabetes and thyroid cancer, but patients with diabetes duration <5 years have a significantly lower risk. Sulfonylurea may increase the risk of thyroid cancer.Unclassified pleomorphic and spindle cell pulmonary neoplasm with brain metastases after prasugrel. There was an excess of new solid neoplasms (112 vs. 69), and cancer deaths (24 vs. 15) after prasugrel in the TRITON (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition). These cancers usually occur after 4 months following prasugrel, and women are especially at risk. The hypothesis has been offered that prasugrel, but not aspirin or clopidogrel, causes indirect modulation of tumor growth, and/or enhanced metastatic dissemination due to instability of platelet-tumor cell aggregates via the inability to keep cancer locally within the platelet thrombi due to excessive chronic platelet inhibition. A 70-year old female diabetic patient underwent drug-eluting stent implantation. The patient received a loading dose of prasugrel (60 mg), followed by prasugrel 10 mg/daily as well as aspirin (81 mg/daily). After 4 months on dual antiplatelet therapy she expectorated blood when coughing. A lung X-ray and CT scan revealed numerous lung nodules later diagnosed as unclassified pleomorphic and spindle cell malignant solid neoplasm. The patient died following multiple brain metastasis. Female gender, duration of prasugrel exposure, rare unclassified neoplasm pathology type and a tumor of a highly metastatic and aggressive nature in the index patient should be regarded with caution. The effects of novel antiplatelet agents on the onset of cancer should be tested in future mega-trials.The associations between bullous pemphigoid and drug use: a UK case-control study. To explore associations between bullous pemphigoid (BP) and previous drug use in the United Kingdom. A case-control study comparing the drug history of consecutive patients with BP and control subjects. Tertiary care center for immunobullous diseases and skin tumor clinics at Oxford University Hospitals. Eighty-six consecutive BP patients and 134 consecutive controls from the same region and similar in age and sex who presented with other dermatological diagnoses. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval of BP in relation to each drug. Loop diuretics were used significantly more frequently by the BP patients (crude odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.2-5.0 P= .02] adjusted odds ratio, 3.8 [1.5-9.7 P= .006]). No significant differences were found between groups for use of other diuretics, aspirin, antidepressants, antiepileptics, antihypertensives, or central nervous system agents (eg, antipsychotics). Patients with BP used calcium or vitamin D supplements, antibiotics, antihistamines, and prednisolone significantly more often on multivariate analysis. The findings of our study demonstrate increased use of loop diuretics in patients with BP before the development of BP. The mechanism behind such an association clearly warrants further investigation.Non-intubated, uniportal, video assisted thoracic surgery VATS] lobectomy, as a new procedure in our department]. Due to the emerging experience in VATS (video assisted thoracic surgery) lobectomies, in some centers the so called non-intubated VATS lobectomies (NITS - non-intubated thoracic surgery) gained increased authority, during which endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation of the patient is not carried out, thus surgery is being performed with the patient breathing spontaneously. The recent study deals with our initial experience gained during uniportal NITS VATS lobectomies. Between 24.01.2017 and 10.03.2017, 16 patients (female: 8 male: 8) with lung cancer underwent NITS VATS uniportal lobectomy. Mean age was 59.6 years (42-73 years). Mean FEV1 was 87.7% (62-109). Mean BMI was 27.1 (18.8-32.8). Prior to surgery, the patients received benzodiazepine premedication, local anesthetic (Lidocaine) for incision and Bupivacaine for intercostal and vagus nerve blockage. Besides routine monitoring Bispectoral Index (BIS) guided target-controlled infusion (TCI) Propofol sedation was carried out, with the help of laryngeal mask anesthesia. Skin and soft tissue incision was performed at the fifth intercostal space, in the axillary line. This single incision sight was the only one needed for the introduction of the camera, together with the instruments needed for dissection and resection of the lobe and placement of the chest tube. Complete atelectasis can develop. The following lobes were removed: 7 right upper lobes, 2 mid-lobes, 1 right lower lobe, 1 right lower lobe + right upper lobe wedge resection, 5 left lower lobes. After the resections, extended mediastinal sampling or block dissection was performed. There was no perioperative mortality. Conversion to endotracheal intubation was needed in non of the cases. Mean operative time was 96,5 minutes (80-120 min.), mean drainage periode was 2.9 days (2-8 days). Prolonged air leak was 1/16 (6.25%). Postoperative fever occurred in 1 patient and subcutaneous emphysema in 1 case, and 1 pneumonia. Because of a recurrent pneumothorax, a re-drainage was necessary in 1 case. Pathology of the resected lobes were as follows: 1 endobronchial hamartochondroma causing complete atelectasis of the lobe, 1 chronic pneumonia, and 10 adenocarcinomas, 2 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 carcinosarcoma, and 1 typical carcinoid. Staging of the 14 malignant cases were as follows: 8 IA, 2 IB, 1 IIA, 2 IIB, and 1 IIIA. The average number of the removed mediastinal lymph nodes is 12 (7-20). Non-intubated (NITS) VATS lobectomy is considered a safe procedure, satisfying all aspects of oncological guidelines. The postoperative drainage period was shorter caused by the complete atelectasis during the surgery.Intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine promotes postoperative sleep and recovery following radical mastectomy under general anesthesia. Postoperative sleep disturbance and fatigue following radical mastectomy were high risks for prolonged convalescence in patients with breast cancer. The present study was designed to observe the effect of intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine on postoperative sleep, fatigue and recovery following radical mastectomy under general anesthesia. Forty-seven patients were randomized into two groups that were maintained with propofol/remifentanil/Ringer\\'s solution (Control group), or propofol/remifentanil/Dexmedetomidine (DEX group) for surgery under general anesthesia. During the first night following surgery, patients receiving dexmedetomine spent more time sleeping when compared with those form the Control group. During the first week following operation, when compared with the Control group, patients from the DEX group had a higher score of global 40-item recovery questionnaire on day 3 following operation, and lower 9-question fatigue severity scores on day 3 and day 7 following operation. In conclusion, intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine is sufficient to improve postoperative sleep disorder, promote postoperative recovery. The adverse effect of dexmedetomidine on sleep disturbance might be contributed to its recovery-promoting effect.A case of left frontal high-grade glioma diagnosed during pregnancy. As pregnancy accelerates glioma growth, therapeutic abortion has been recommended prior to tumor resection. Additionally, it has also been suggested that the extent of glioma resection is closely correlated with patient survival. A 162-cm, 61.4-kg, 30-year-old, right-handed primigravida was referred to our institution at 21√å√¢√•√äweeks gestation to obtain a second opinion. At 18√å√¢√•√äweeks gestation, the patient developed new-onset generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs), which were poorly controlled by anticonvulsant polytherapy, early in the second trimester. A 6-cm lesion located in her left frontal supplementary motor area (SMA) was suspected as a grade III glioma, classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Due to the limited evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy during pregnancy, tumors causing neurological symptoms and seizures must be treated, in order to stabilize the maternal condition and enable a safe birth. In the case of pregnant patients, awake craniotomy using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) is considered advantageous, achieving gross total resection with a reduction of direct cortical stimulation, which may induce seizure, and so reducing fetal exposure to anesthetics. The Asleep-Awake-Asleep technique was performed at 27√å√¢√•√äweeks and 2√å√¢√•√ädays gestation. As use of propofol in pregnant patients is prohibited, general anesthesia was maintained through administration of sevoflurane and remifentanil until the first scan of iMRI, and was subsequently re-induced with dexmedetomidine when tumor removal had been accomplished. A supraglottic airway (SGA) was used until the patient\\'s cranium was opened. There were no complications during either the procedure or the post-operative period. At 35√å√¢√•√äweeks gestation, the patient delivered a healthy baby of 2317√å√¢√•√äg. Pathological examination of the patient, revealed an anaplastic astrocytoma, thus radiotherapy and chemotherapy began 2√å√¢√•√ämonths post-delivery. There is no evidence of tumor recurrence in the patient and the child did not show any medical or developmental concerns at the point of the 17-month follow-up. Since evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy during pregnancy is limited, extensive resection with functional monitoring is recommended if a brain tumor is presumed to be malignant. Awake craniotomy is considered advantageous to pregnant patients because subjective movement preserves the patient\\'s motor function and reduces fetal exposure to anesthetics. Therefore, providing multidisciplinary discussion takes place within the decision-making process, as well as careful perioperative preparation, awake craniotomy should be considered, even in the case of pregnant patients.Retrospective cohort mortality study and nested case-control study of workers exposed to creosote at 11 wood-treating plants in the United States. The objective of this study was to assess both malignant and nonmalignant mortality risks of workers exposed to creosote. For background, a literature review is also presented. The retrospective cohort study consisted of 2179 employees at 11 plants in the United States where wood (primarily railroad ties and utility poles) is treated with creosote-based preservatives. The observation period covered 1979-2001. Mortality data in the cohort study were analyzed in terms of cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), with expected deaths based on U.S. national cause-, gender-, race-, year-, age-specific mortality rates. In addition to the cohort investigation, a nested case-control study of lung cancer and multiple myeloma was conducted. Information on tobacco consumption and detailed employment (job titles) was obtained for cases and matched controls. Jobs were classified into 5 categories according to potential for exposure to creosote. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated for job categories and length of exposure. Overall mortality for the entire cohort was lower than expected (293 observed deaths vs. 325.37 expected, SMR = 90.1, 95% CI = 80.0-101.0). Close to 90% employees were hourly, whose potential for exposure was generally much higher than that of salaried employees. Among hourly employees, except for multiple myeloma, none of the specific cancer sites showed any significant increase. Furthermore, detailed analysis by length of employment did not reveal any significant mortality excess or upward trend. Six deaths were from multiple myeloma, whereas 1.50 deaths were expected (SMR = 401.1, 95% CI = 147.2-873.1). However, analysis by length of employment did not show any upward trend for multiple myeloma. No significant mortality increase was reported for any nonmalignant disease, and analysis by length of employment did not reveal any upward trend. In the case-control study, an increased risk of lung cancer was associated with tobacco consumption (OR = 4.92) but not with any job/exposure category. For example, the lung cancer odds ratio for routine exposure to creosote-based wood preservatives was 0.58 (95% CI = 0.11-3.03). Similarly, case-control analyses of multiple myeloma did not reveal any association with employment at the plants or with exposure to creosote-based wood preservatives or to creosote-treated products. Based on the present investigation and other studies, there was no evidence that employment at the 11 wood-treating plants or exposure to creosote-based wood preservatives was associated with any significant mortality increase from site-specific cancers or nonmalignant diseases. Some results should be interpreted with caution because they were based on small numbers.Tumor Prevalence in Mummichogs from the Delaware Estuary Watershed. Mummichogs Fundulus heteroclitus were collected in 2002-2004 from six locations within the Delaware Estuary watershed and examined histopathologically. The objective was to compare the prevalence of skin and liver tumors in fish from locations with a range of sediment polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) based on available data. Fish were collected from (1) three locations within the industrialized Christina River subwatershed (Hershey Run, Newport Marsh (upriver and downriver)) (2) one location in the Motiva Enterprises refinery discharge canal to the Delaware River (3) one location in the St. Jones River and (4) one location in Blackbird Creek. Adult mummichogs (√å¬¢\\x89√õ¬°√•¬¥70 mm n = 21-30 fish per location) were seined and held for necropsy. No neoplastic skin lesions were diagnosed in any fish. No liver tumors were diagnosed in the St. Jones, Motiva, Newport Marsh upriver, or Newport Marsh downriver collections. One of 30 Blackbird Creek mummichogs had foci of hepatocellular alteration (a putative preneoplastic lesion) and one had hepatocellular carcinoma. There was a significant difference in hepatocellular carcinoma prevalence in Hershey Run mummichogs in 2002 (9 of 21 fish, or 43%) and in 2003 (3 of 29 fish, or 10%) compared with all other locations pooled (1 of 145 fish, or 0.7%). Hershey Run is contaminated with creosote from an adjacent Superfund site, where sediments were frequently reported to have total PAH concentrations greater than 100 mg of total PAH/kg and a maximum of 13,300 mg/kg. No other locations had reports of total PAHs higher than 11 mg/kg. In conclusion, liver neoplasia was associated with exposure to sediment containing high concentrations of PAHs derived from creosote. Studies that include tumor prevalence, biomarkers (e.g., DNA adducts and PAH metabolites in bile), and sediment and/or tissue chemistry are recommended to develop a weight of evidence for specific chemical classes.Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay of plasma and urine O-desmethylangolensin. We present a method for the determination of the phytoestrogen metabolite O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) in plasma (serum) and in urine. O-DMA is a metabolite of daidzein, which occurs in soybeans. It has been suggested that isoflavones may afford protection against breast and prostate cancer and therefore, also the metabolites are of interest. The method is based on time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) using a europium chelate as a label. After the synthesis of 4-O-carboxymethyl-O-DMA, this compound is coupled to bovine serum albumin, and then used as antigen in immunization of rabbits. The tracers with the europium chelate are synthesized using the same 4-O-derivative of the alpha-methyldeoxybenzoin. After enzymatic hydrolysis and ether extraction the immunoassay is carried out by time resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA). Cross-reactivity was tested with angolensin, dihydrogenistein, dihydrodaidzein, equol, 6\\'-OH-angolensin, trans-4-OH-equol, 6\\'-OH-O-DMA, cis-4-OH-equol and 5-OH-equol. The antiserum cross-reacted only with angolensin. This cross-reactivity seems not to influence the results, which were highly specific. Plasma samples are hydrolyzed and extracted. Urine samples are analyzed directly after hydrolysis without extraction. The correlation coefficient between the plasma TR-FIA results and the GC-MS results was high r value was 0.985. The correlation coefficient between the urine TR-FIA results and the GC-MS results was high over the entire range of concentrations (0-1500 nmol/l) r value was 0.976, but lower in the low concentration range (0-100 nmol/l), i.e. value was 0.631. The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for plasma O-DMA concentrations and for urine O-DMA concentrations at three different concentrations varied 2.8-7.7 and 3.0-6.0%, respectively and the inter-assay CVs varied 3.8-8.9 and 4.4-6.6%, respectively. The working range of the plasma and urine O-DMA assays was 0.5-512 nmol/l.In vitro incubation of human feces with daidzein and antibiotics suggests interindividual differences in the bacteria responsible for equol production. Daidzein can be metabolized to equol, dihydrodaidzein (DHD), and O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) by intestinal bacteria. Only one third to one half of individuals produce equol, and evidence exists to support potential cancer-protective effects of equol production. We investigated the in vitro metabolism of daidzein by fecal bacteria and assessed the effect of several antibiotics on metabolism. Fresh or previously frozen feces from 7 equol producers and 6 nonproducers were incubated with daidzein, with or without antibiotics, for 5 d at 37 degrees C. With the exception of one previously frozen sample, fecal inoculates from equol producers converted daidzein to equol. Conversion occurred under anaerobic, but not aerobic conditions. Fecal inoculates from equol nonproducers did not produce equol, but some produced ODMA and DHD. Between-subject differences in the effects of antibiotics on daidzein metabolism were apparent. Some antibiotics inhibited the production of equol but had no effect on DHD production. These results suggest that several bacteria may be involved in daidzein metabolism, and that they may differ among subjects. This simple in vitro system can facilitate the study of factors influencing equol production and minimize the need for animal models or human interventions. Furthermore, these analyses can be conducted on fecal samples that have been frozen and stored.Mammographic density in relation to daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes in overweight, postmenopausal women. Circulating hormones are associated with mammographic density, an intermediate marker of breast cancer risk. Differences in circulating hormones, including estrone and testosterone, have been observed in premenopausal women based on their capacity to metabolize daidzein, an isoflavone found predominantly in soybeans. Equol and O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) are products of intestinal bacterial metabolism of daidzein. There is interindividual variability in the capacity to produce daidzein metabolites individuals can be equol producers or non-producers and O-DMA producers or non-producers. We tested the hypothesis that daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes are associated with mammographic density. Participants were recruited from among 92 sedentary, postmenopausal women, ages 50 to 75 years, who participated in a 1-year physical activity intervention. Pre-intervention mammographic density was determined using a computer-assisted, gray-scale thresholding technique. Fifty-five of these women consumed supplemental soy protein (>10 mg daidzein/d) for 3 days and collected a first-void urine sample on the fourth day to determine daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes. Equol and O-DMA concentrations were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Associations between daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes and percent mammographic density were adjusted for age, maximum adult weight, gravidity, family history of breast cancer, and serum follicle-stimulating hormone and free testosterone concentrations. Mammographic density was 39% lower in equol producers compared with non-producers (P = 0.04). O-DMA producers had mammographic density 69% greater than non-producers (P = 0.05). These results suggest that particular intestinal bacterial profiles are associated with postmenopausal mammographic density, and these associations are not entirely explained by differences in reproductive or anthropometric characteristics or circulating hormones.Prevalence of daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes differs between Caucasian and Korean American women and girls. Interindividual differences in metabolism of the soy isoflavone, daidzein, to equol and O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) by human gut bacteria, have been associated with altered risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, according to some studies. Differences have been reported in the prevalence of the equol-producer phenotype among populations, with a higher prevalence in soy-consuming Asian populations than in Western populations. To date, prevalence of the daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes in Asians, compared with Caucasians, has not been evaluated in the context of a standardized phenotyping method. We assessed the prevalence of equol- and ODMA-producer phenotypes in 91 Korean American (KA) women and girls living in the Seattle, Washington area and compared this with previous similarly collected prevalence data in Caucasian American (CA) women and girls (n = 222). We also compared the dietary habits of the 2 groups. Isoflavonoid concentrations in first-void morning urines, collected after a 3-d soy challenge, were used to establish equol-, and ODMA-producer phenotypes (>44 microg/L). The prevalence of the equol-producer phenotype was higher (51 vs. 36% P = 0.015) and the ODMA-producer phenotype was lower (84 vs. 92%, P = 0.03) in KA than in CA women and girls. KAs consumed approximately 3 times more soy foods than the CAs, but no significant associations were found between the consumption of soy foods and equol-producer phenotype. Our findings support the reports that, compared with Western populations, Asian populations have a higher equol-producer prevalence. The additional observation that the prevalence of the ODMA-producer phenotype is lower in KAs suggests that daidzein-metabolizing patterns in general may differ between KAs and CAs.Phytoestrogen exposure, polymorphisms in COMT, CYP19, ESR1, and SHBG genes, and their associations with prostate cancer risk. Prospective phytoestrogen exposure was assessed using both biomarkers and estimates of intake in 89 British men recruited into the Norfolk arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, men who subsequently developed prostate cancer. Results were compared with those from 178 healthy men matched by age and date of recruitment. Levels of seven phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin, equol, enterodiol, and enterolactone) were measured in spot urine and serum samples. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in COMT, CYP19, ESR1, and SHBG genes were genotyped. Urinary levels of all phytoestrogens correlated strongly with serum levels. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.63 (glycitein) to 0.88 (daidzein) (P < 0.001). Urinary and serum levels correlated significantly with isoflavone intake assessed from food diaries (R = 0.15-0.20 P < 0.05) but not with that from a food-frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios for phytoestrogen exposure, as assessed using the four methods, were not significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (P = 0.15-0.94). Men with the CC genotype for the ESRI PvuII polymorphism had significantly higher risk for prostate cancer compared with men with the TT genotype [adjusted odds ratio = 4.65 (1.60-13.49) P = 0.005]. Our results utilizing a combined prospective exposure provide no evidence that phytoestrogens alter prostate cancer risk in British men, whereas the C allele for the PvuII polymorphism may be associated with increased risk.Variations in plasma phytoestrogen concentrations in European adults. Dietary phytoestrogens may play a role in chronic disease occurrence. The aim of our study was to assess the variability of plasma concentrations in European populations. We included 15 geographical regions in 9 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands, and UK) and a 16th region, Oxford, UK, where participants were recruited from among vegans and vegetarians. All subjects were participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Plasma concentrations of 3 isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein), 2 metabolites of daidzein [O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol] and 2 mammalian lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) were measured in 1414 participants. We computed geometric means for each region and used multivariate regression analysis to assess the influence of region, adjusted for gender, age, BMI, alcohol intake, smoking status, and laboratory batch. Many subjects had concentrations below the detection limit [0.1 microg/L (0.4 nmol/L)] for glycitein (80%), O-DMA (73%) and equol (62%). Excluding subjects from Oxford, UK, the highest concentrations of isoflavones were in subjects from the Netherlands and Cambridge, UK [2-6 microg/L (7-24 nmol/L) P < 0.05], whereas concentrations for lignans were highest in Denmark [8 microg/L (27 nmol/L) P < 0.05]. Isoflavones varied 8- to 13-fold, whereas lignans varied 4-fold. In the vegetarian/vegan cohort of Oxford, concentrations of isoflavones were 5-50 times higher than in nonvegetarian regions. Region was the most important determinant of plasma concentrations for all 7 phytoestrogens. Despite the fact that plasma concentrations of phytoestrogens in Europe were low compared with Asian populations, they varied substantially among subjects from the 16 different regions.Daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes in relation to mammographic breast density among premenopausal women in the United States. Mammographic breast density is an established marker of breast cancer risk, and is hormonally sensitive. Studies suggest that production of the daidzein metabolites equol and O-Desmethylangolensin (ODMA) may be associated with hormones and hormonally mediated factors, but few studies have assessed relationships between the capacity to produce these metabolites and breast density. To evaluate the relationship between equol- and ODMA-producer phenotypes and breast density in premenopausal women in the United States. Two hundred and three women attended a clinic visit and 200 provided a urine sample following a 3 day soy challenge. Samples were analyzed for isoflavones by GC-MS to determine daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes. Percent density on recent (87.5 ng/ml urine), respectively. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there were no differences in breast density between producers and non-producers of either equol or ODMA (P > 0.05). In this population of low-soy consuming premenopausal women, there were no associations between daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes and breast density, suggesting that these phenotypes per se do not influence premenopausal breast density.Lack of prospective associations between plasma and urinary phytoestrogens and risk of prostate or colorectal cancer in the European Prospective into Cancer-Norfolk study. Dietary phytoestrogens are suggested to reduce the risk of prostate and colorectal cancer, but the results of epidemiologic studies have not yielded consistent support for this proposed effect, possibly due to inadequate databases of phytoestrogen levels in foods. Biomarkers of phytoestrogen intakes may provide a clearer insight into the relationship between phytoestrogen exposure and the risk of prostate or colorectal cancer risks. From the European Prospective into Cancer-Norfolk cohort (ages 45-75), serum and urine samples were analyzed for seven phytoestrogens [daidzein, enterodiol, enterolactone, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), and equol] among 193 cases of prostate cancer and 828 controls, and 221 cases of colorectal cancer with 889 controls. Summary variables of total lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) and total isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, O-DMA, equol, and glycitein) were created and analyzed in conjunction with individual phytoestrogens. Logistic regression analyses revealed that there was no significant association between prostate cancer risk and total serum isoflavones [odds ratio (OR), 1.01 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.93-1.10] or total serum lignans (OR, 0.94 95% CI, 0.86-1.04) or between colorectal cancer risk and total serum isoflavones (OR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.94-1.08) or total serum lignans (OR, 1.03 95% CI, 0.94-1.12). Similarly, null associations were observed for individual serum phytoestrogens and for all urinary phytoestrogen biomarkers. In conclusion, we have found no evidence to support an inverse association between phytoestrogen exposure and prostate or colorectal cancer risk.Urine accurately reflects circulating isoflavonoids and ascertains compliance during soy intervention. Isoflavonoids (IFL) may protect against chronic diseases, including cancer. IFL exposure is traditionally measured from plasma (PL), but the reliability of urine is uncertain. We assessed whether IFL excretion in overnight urine (OU) or spot urine (SU) reliably reflects IFLs in PL and the usefulness of the three matrices to determine soy intake compliance. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled soy intervention trial with 350 postmenopausal women, IFLs (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, equol, O-desmethylangolensin, dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein) were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in OU, SU, and PL collected at baseline and every 6 months over 2.5 years. High between-subject intraclass correlations between all three matrices (median, 0.94) and high between-subject Pearson correlations (median r(OU-PL) = 0.80 median r(SU-PL) = 0.80 median r(OU-SU) = 0.92) allowed the development of equations to predict IFL values from any of the three matrices. Equations developed from a randomly selected 87% of all available data were valid because high correlations were found on the residual 13% of data between equation-generated and measured IFL values (median r(OU-PL) = 0.86 median r(SU-PL) = 0.78 median r(OU-SU) = 0.84) median absolute IFL differences for OU-PL, SU-PL, and OU-SU were 8.8 nmol/L, 10.3 nmol/L, and 0.28 nmol/mg, respectively. All three matrices showed highly significant IFL differences between the placebo and soy intervention group at study end (P < 0.0001) and highly significant correlations between IFL values and counted soy doses in the intervention group. OU and SU IFL excretion reflect circulating PL IFL levels in healthy postmenopausal women accurately. Noninvasively-collected urine can be used to reliably determine systemic IFL exposure and soy intake compliance.Profiles of phytoestrogens in human urine from several Asian countries. Intake of a diet rich in phytoestrogens has been associated with a decreased risk for hormone-dependent cancers in humans. Biomonitoring of phytoestrogens in human urine has been used to assess the intake of phytoestrogens. Although studies have reported phytoestrogen levels in urine specimens from the United States and Japan, little is known of human intake of phytoestrogens in other Asian countries. In this study we determined the concentrations of seven phytoestrogens, namely, enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), genistein, and coumestrol, in 199 human urine samples from three Asian countries, Vietnam (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh), Cambodia (Phnom Penh), and India (Chennai and Kolkata), using a simple, sensitive, and reliable liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method. The residue levels of phytoestrogens in urine samples from the three Asian countries were compared with the concentrations in 26 urine samples from Japan (Ehime) and 16 urine samples from the United States (Albany), analyzed in this study. Among the phytoestrogens analyzed, isoflavones such as daidzein and genistein were predominant in urine samples from Vietnam samples from Cambodia and India contained higher concentrations of enterolactone than isoflavones. Urinary concentrations of isoflavones in samples from Hanoi, Vietnam, were notably higher than the concentrations in samples from Cambodia, India, and the United States and similar to the concentrations in samples from Japan. The lowest concentrations of daidzein and the highest concentrations of enterolactone were found in urine samples from India. Concentrations of equol and O-DMA, which are microbial transformation products of daidzein (produced by gut microflora), were notably high in urine samples from Hanoi, Vietnam. The ratios of the concentration of equol or O-DMA to that of daidzein were significantly higher in samples from Hanoi than from Japan, indicating high biotransformation efficiency of daidzein by the population in Hanoi. High concentrations of equol, in addition to isoflavones, in urine have been linked to reduced breast cancer risk in previous studies, and, thus, the Vietnamese population may have potential protective effect against breast cancer. This study suggests that the dietary intake and profiles of phytoestrogens vary considerably, even among Asian countries.Correlations of urinary phytoestrogen excretion with lifestyle factors and dietary intakes among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women. Isoflavones and lignans, two major groups of phytoestrogens, have been postulated to have multiple health benefits, including anti-estrogenic, anti-cancer, pro-cardiovascular health, and ameliorating menopausal symptoms. Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids, including daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), dihydro-daidzein, dihydrogenistein, and equol, and lignans, including enterodiol and enterolactone, have been used as biomarkers of phytoestrogen exposure in epidemiologic studies. We evaluated the urinary excretion of phytoestrogens and their correlations with lifestyle and dietary factors among 2,165 women who participated in the Shanghai Women\\'s Health Study (SWHS), a population-based prospective cohort study of 74,942 urban Chinese women aged 40-70 years at study enrollment (1996-2000). The medians (in nmol/mg creatinine) were: isoflavonoids, 17.13 daidzein, 5.57 genistein, 2.41 glycitein, 0.94 O-DMA, 1.52 dihydrodaidzein, 0.81 dihydrogenistein, 0.19 equol, 0.11 enterodiol, 0.30 and enterolactone, 1.18. These levels are 2- (enterodiol) to 126- (O-DMA) fold higher than levels among US women similar in age range with the exception of enterolactone, for which a similar level was observed for both populations. Urinary isoflavonoid excretion was higher among older women and women who engaged in regular exercise and significantly associated with soy food intake, but was inversely related to fruit intake. Urinary excretions of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, equol, enterodiol, and enterolactone were inversely associated with body mass index (BMI). Urinary excretion of isoflavones correlated with soy food intake and healthy lifestyle but was inversely associated with fruit intake among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women. Our study adds important information to the rapidly growing body of research on the potential health benefits of phytoestrogens.Urinary enterolactone is associated with obesity and metabolic alteration in men in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-10. Phyto-oestrogens are a family of plant-derived xeno-oestrogens that have been shown to prevent cancer in some studies. Whether phyto-oestrogen intake affects obesity status in a population is still unclear. In the present cross-sectional study, we examined the association of urinary phyto-oestrogen metabolites with obesity and metabolic parameters in children and adults. Data from 1294 children (age 6-19 years) and from 3661 adults (age √å¬¢\\x89√õ¬°√•¬¥√å√¢√•√ä20 years) who participated in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-10 were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to investigate the associations of BMI, waist circumference, serum metabolites (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, TAG, fasting glucose and fasting insulin) and the metabolic syndrome with urinary phyto-oestrogen levels. When stratified by age and sex, we found a stronger association (OR 0√å√¢√•√°30, 95√å√¢√•√ä% CI 0√å√¢√•√°17, 0√å√¢√•√°54 P60 years) in the same survey. However, no associations with urinary daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin, equol, enterodiol or genistein were found in the overall population. We also found that the elevation of enterolactone levels was inversely associated with TAG levels, fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin levels and the metabolic syndrome in males aged 20-60 years, but positively associated with HDL-cholesterol levels. The present results provide epidemiological evidence that urinary enterolactone is inversely associated with obesity in adult males.Urinary isoflavonoids and risk of type 2 diabetes: a prospective investigation in US women. To examine the association between urinary excretion of isoflavonoids and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a nested case-control study among 1111 T2D pairs identified during 1995-2008 in the Nurses\\' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII, who were free of diabetes, CVD and cancer at urine sample collection. Urinary excretion of daidzein and genistein, as well as their metabolites O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), dihydrogenistein (DHGE) and dihydrodaidzein (DHDE) was assayed using liquid chromatography MS. Self-reported T2D incident cases were confirmed using a validated questionnaire. Higher urinary excretion of daidzein and genistein was associated with a lower risk of T2D in the combined cohorts. Comparing extreme tertiles of the urinary markers, the OR of T2D were 0√å√¢√•√°71 (95 % CI 0√å√¢√•√°55, 0√å√¢√•√°93) for daidzein and 0√å√¢√•√°74 (95 % CI 0√å√¢√•√°56, 0√å√¢√•√°97) for genistein, although the test for linear trend was not significant for genistein (P trend=0√å√¢√•√°03 and 0√å√¢√•√°15, respectively). DMA, DHDE and DHGE were non-significantly associated with a lower T2D risk. The inverse association of daidzein with T2D risk was stronger among post-menopausal women who did not use hormone replacement therapy (P interaction=0√å√¢√•√°001): the OR was 0√å√¢√•√°58 (95 % CI 0√å√¢√•√°34, 0√å√¢√•√°97) comparing extreme tertiles among these women. In conclusion, urinary excretion of isoflavones was associated with a lower T2D risk in US women, especially among post-menopausal women who did not use hormone. Further research is warranted to replicate these observations among western populations with similarly low overall isoflavone intake.Comparative study on effects of puerarin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in treating acute myocardial infarction. To compare the effects of puerarin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in treating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and on the size of infarcted area and cytokines. Seventy-nine patients with anterior AMI were randomly divided into three groups, they were treated with conventional Western medical treatment, but to the puerarin group (PG) and the G-CSF group (GCG) puerarin and G-CSF was given additionally, respectively. The infarcted size, plasma G-CSF, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected before and after treatment. The infarcted size was positively correlated to the levels of G-CSF, MMP-9, IL-6 and TNF-alpha before treatment ( r = 0.45, 0.42, 0.44 and 0.42, P0.05). Puerarin and G-CSF are effective in decreasing infarcted size, but their effects on cytokines are different entirely.Rapid HPLC analysis of dietary phytoestrogens from legumes and from human urine. Due to growing evidence suggesting that phytoestrogens might protect against various cancers, particularly against breast and prostate cancer, it is important to measure the exposure of populations to these compounds by determining levels in food and in human tissue or body fluids to assess the possible cancer protective properties of these agents. Therefore, we developed a simple and fast procedure to extract and simultaneously hydrolyze phytoestrogens and their conjugates from food items, and present a fast and selective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for precise determinations of the most common dietary phytoestrogens genistein, biochanin-A, daidzein, formononetin, and coumestrol using flavone as internal standard. For the first time HPLC was applied to measure these phytoestrogens and their most abundant metabolites equol and O-desmethyl-angolensin from human urine. The proposed methodology has been evaluated for losses due to thermal degradation during extraction and hydrolysis and due to sample handling during the entire work-up including solid phase extraction, and values are given for inter- and intra-assay variability. We present isoflavonoid levels of most common peas and beans used in western and eastern diets and compare isoflavonoid and coumestrol levels of raw, canned, and cooked foods which can be used in future epidemiological studies. We also determined human urinary levels with our methodology comparing values before and after soybean intake.In vitro evaluation of Sun Protection Factor and stability of commercial sunscreens using mass spectrometry. Sunlight exposure causes several types of injury to humans, especially on the skin among the most common harmful effects due to ultraviolet (UV) exposure are erythema, pigmentation and lesions in DNA, which may lead to cancer. These long-term effects are minimized with the use of sunscreens, a class of cosmetic products that contains UV filters as the main component in the formulation such molecules can absorb, reflect or diffuse UV rays, and can be used alone or as a combination to broaden the protection on different wavelengths. Currently, worldwide regulatory agencies define which ingredients and what quantities must be used in each country, and enforce companies to conduct tests that confirm the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and the UVA (Ultraviolet A) factor. Standard SPF determination tests are currently conducted in vivo, using human subjects. In an industrial mindset, apart from economic and ethical reasons, the introduction of an in vitro method emerges as an interesting alternative by reducing risks associated to UV exposure on tests, as well as providing assertive analytical results. The present work aims to describe a novel methodology for SPF determination directly from sunscreen formulations using the previously described cosmetomics platform and mass spectrometry as the analytical methods of choice.Genetic variants and risk of gastric cancer: a pathway analysis of a genome-wide association study. This study aimed to discover candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for hypothesizing significant biological pathways of gastric cancer (GC). We performed an Identify Candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways (ICSNPathway) analysis using a GC genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset, including 472,342 SNPs in 2,240 GC cases and 3,302 controls of Asian ethnicity. By integrating linkage disequilibrium analysis, functional SNP annotation, and pathway-based analysis, seven candidate SNPs, four genes and 12 pathways were selected. The ICSNPathway analysis produced 4 hypothetical mechanisms of GC: (1) rs4745 and rs12904√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°EFNA1√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°ephrin receptor binding (2) rs1801019√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°UMPS√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°drug and pyrimidine metabolism (3) rs364897√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°GBA√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°cyanoamino acid metabolism and (4) rs11187870, rs2274223, and rs3765524√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°PLCE1√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™√å¬¢\\x89√¢√Ç\\x89√õ¬°lipid biosynthetic process, regulation of cell growth, and cation homeostasis. This pathway analysis using GWAS dataset suggests that the 4 hypothetical biological mechanisms might contribute to GC susceptibility.Short leukocyte telomere length, alone and in combination with smoking, contributes to increased risk of gastric cancer or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In humans, telomeres shorten along with division of somatic cells. Shortened telomere length might result in genomic instability and has been associated with several malignancies. However, the findings in different populations remain conflicting. Therefore, we assessed the association of telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes with risk of gastric cancer (GC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in a Chinese Han population. A total of 574 GC cases, 740 ESCC cases and 774 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression. The GC or ESCC patients had significantly shorter relative telomere length (RTL) (median √å√¢√•¬± SD: GC: 1.20 √å√¢√•¬± 0.42 ESCC: 1.27 √å√¢√•¬± 0.48) than controls (1.41 √å√¢√•¬± 0.58). Four-fold increased GC risk (OR = 4.10, 95% CI = 2.78-6.05, P = 1.10 √å√Ñ\\x89√õ√ì 10-12) or 1.56-fold increased ESCC risk (95% CI = 1.12-2.18, P = 0.009) among subjects in the shortest quartile of telomere length was found compared with the highest quartile. We also observed a cumulative effect between short RTL and smoking in intensifying risk of GC (P = 4.50 √å√Ñ\\x89√õ√ì 10-9) or ESCC (P = 5.92 √å√Ñ\\x89√õ√ì 10-33). Moreover, there were cumulative effects between RTL, smoking and drinking in elevating risk of GC (Ptrend = 0.001) or ESCC (Ptrend = 1.57 √å√Ñ\\x89√õ√ì 10-32). Interestingly, RTL-related rs621559 and rs398652 genetic variants are significantly associated with GC risk. These results indicate that short RTL is involved in susceptibility to developing GC or ESCC, alone and in a gene-environment interaction manner. Short telomere length might be a potential molecular marker, in combination with lifestyle risk factors, to identify high-risk individuals.Determination of liquiritigenin by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry: Application to a linear pharmacokinetic study of liquiritigenin in rat plasma. A simple, sensitive and rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the quantification of liquiritigenin, a promising anti-tumor agent. Liquiritigenin and the internal standard were separated on an Agilent Extend C18 column and eluted with a gradient mobile phase system of acetonitrile and water. The analysis was performed on a negative ionization electrospray mass spectrometer via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Transitions of m/z 255.0√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™119.0 for liquiritigenin and m/z 269.0√å¬¢\\x89√õ√ä\\x89√õ¬™117.0 for the IS were monitored. One-step protein precipitation with acetonitrile was used to remove impurities and extract the analytes from plasma. The method had a chromatographic run time of 4.5min and a good linearity in the range of 1-1000ng/mL. The precision (R.S.D.) of intra-day and inter-day ranged from 4.54 to 10.65% and 5.94 to 13.81%, respectively while the accuracy of intra-day and inter-day ranged from 104.06 to 109.28% and 94.98 to 112.05%. The recovery and stability were also within the acceptable limits. The validated method was applied to a linear pharmacokinetic study of liquiritigenin in rat plasma for the first time.Effects of emodin and baicalein on rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To investigate the therapeutic effects of emodin in combination with baicalein on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) rats and to explore the mechanism of SAP. A total of 112 SAP rats induced by retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the biliary-pancreatic duct, randomly assigned to a untreated group and three treated groups emodin group, combined emodin and baicalein group, and sandostatin group. Meanwhile, another 28 other rats were selected as sham operation (SO) group. There were 28 rats in each group, 8 rats were in 3 and 6 h groups respectively, and 12 rats in 12 h group. At each time-points, survival rates, ascites volumes, pathological lesion scores of pancreas tissues, serum amylase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 levels were determined as the indexes of therapeutic effects. The survival rate at 12 h was significantly higher in three treated groups than in untreated group. The ascites volume at 12 h was remarkably less in combined and sandostatin groups than in emodin group, but there was no difference between combined group and sandostatin group (P>0.05). Serum amylase levels at all time-points were significantly lower in three treated groups than in untreated group. However, they had no difference among treated groups (P>0.05). Serum TNF-alpha were lower in three treated groups than in untreated group at all time points. Among the three treated groups, at 6 h, the TNF-alpha levels of combination and sandostatin groups were lower than those of emodin group. These was no difference between combined and sandostantin. Serum IL-6 concentration at 3 h were lower in combined and sandostatin groups than in untreated group, but at 6 and 12 h they were lower in all treated groups than in untreated group and the combined and sandostatin groups and in emodin group, no difference was found between combined and sandostatin groups at all time-points (P>0.05). The pathological scores of pancreas at all time points were significantly lower in three treated groups than in the untreated group, and at 6, 12 h, the scores of combined and sandostatin groups were lower than in emodin group. There was no difference between combined and sandostatin groups (P>0.05). Combination of emodin with baicalein has significant therapeutic effects on SAP rats.Development of a new in vitro skin sensitization assay (Epidermal Sensitization Assay EpiSensA) using reconstructed human epidermis. Recent changes in regulatory requirements and social views on animal testing have accelerated the development of reliable alternative tests for predicting skin sensitizing potential of chemicals. In this study, we aimed to develop a new in vitro skin sensitization assay using reconstructed human epidermis, RhE model, which is expected to have broader applicability domain rather than existing in vitro assays. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of five genes (ATF3, DNAJB4, GCLM, HSPA6 and HSPH1) related to cellular stress response were significantly up-regulated in RhE model after 6h treatment with representative skin sensitizers, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and oxazolone, but not a non-sensitizer, benzalkonium chloride. The predictive performance of five genes was examined with eight skin sensitizers (e.g., cinnamic aldehyde), four non-sensitizers (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate) and four pre-/pro-haptens (e.g., p-phenylenediamine, isoeugenol). When the positive criteria were set to obtain the highest accuracy with the animal testing (LLNA), ATF3, DNAJB4 and GCLM exhibited a high predictive accuracy (100%, 93.8% and 87.5%, respectively). All tested pre-/pro-haptens were correctly predicted by both ATF3 and DNAJB4. These results suggested that the RhE-based assay, termed epidermal sensitization assay (EpiSensA), could be an useful skin sensitization assay with a broad applicability domain including pre-/pro-haptens. Parthenolide accumulation and expression of genes related to parthenolide biosynthesis affected by exogenous application of methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid in Tanacetum parthenium. Up-regulation of germacrene A synthase and down-regulation of parthenolide hydroxylase genes play key role in parthenolide accumulation of feverfew plants treated with methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid. Parthenolide is an important sesquiterpene lactone due to its anti-migraine and anti-cancer properties. Parthenolide amount was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography after foliar application of methyl jasmonate (100√å√¢√•√ä√å√¢√•¬µM) or salicylic acid (1.0√å√¢√•√ämM) on feverfew leaves in time course experiment (3-96√å√¢√•√äh). Results indicate that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid activated parthenolide biosynthesis. Parthenolide content reached its highest amount at 24√å√¢√•√äh after methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid treatments, which were 3.1- and 1.96-fold higher than control plants, respectively. Parthenolide transiently increased due to methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid treatments until 24√å√¢√•√äh, but did not show significant difference compared with control plants at 48 and 96√å√¢√•√äh time points in both treatments. Also, the transcript levels of early pathway (upstream) genes of terpene biosynthesis including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase and hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase and the biosynthetic genes of parthenolide including germacrene A synthase, germacrene A oxidase, costunolide synthase and parthenolide synthase were increased by methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid treatments, but with different intensity. The transcriptional levels of these genes were higher in methyl jasmonate-treated plants than salicylic acid-treated plants. Parthenolide content measurements along with expression pattern analysis of the aforementioned genes and parthenolide hydroxylase as side branch gene of parthenolide suggest that the expression patterns of early pathway genes were not directly consistent with parthenolide accumulation pattern hence, parthenolide accumulation is probably further modulated by the expression of its biosynthetic genes, especially germacrene A synthase and also its side branch gene, parthenolide hydroxylase.Serum protein profiling by miniaturized solid-phase extraction and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Serum profiling by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) holds promise as a clinical tool for early diagnosis of cancer and other human diseases. Sample preparation is key to achieving reproducible and well-resolved signals in MALDI-MS a prerequisite for translation of MALDI-MS based diagnostic methods to clinical applications. We have investigated a number of MALDI matrices and several miniaturized solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods for serum protein concentration and desalting with the aim of generating reproducible, high-quality protein profiles by MALDI-MS. We developed a simple protocol for serum profiling that combines a matrix mixture of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid with miniaturized SPE and MALDI-MS. Functionalized membrane discs with hydrophobic, ion-exchange or chelating properties allowed reproducible MALDI mass spectra (m/z 1000-12,000) to be obtained from serum. In a proof-of-principle application, SPE with chelating material and MALDI-MS identified protein peaks in serum that had been previously reported for distinguishing a person diagnosed with breast cancer from a control. These preliminary results indicate that this simple SPE/MALDI-MS method for serum profiling provides a versatile and scalable platform for clinical proteomics.A uniform 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid layer as a matrix for MALDI-FTICR MS-based lipidomics. A very uniform 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) layer was for the first time constructed and used as a matrix for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR MS) for quickly exploring the changes in lipids within biological systems. Lipid extracts from biological samples were dissolved in chloroform and deposited onto the DHB layer. Benefiting from the insolubility of DHB in chloroform, the uniform matrix crystals were still maintained, and more importantly, the lipid analytes were distributed homogeneously on the layer, which significantly increased the reproducibility of analysis using MALDI-FTICR MS. Taking advantage of the benefit of high resolution of FTICR MS and the fragment ions obtained by MS/MS, lots of lipids were identified. This method was used for exploring the changes of lipids in drug-resistant tumor cells compared with paired drug-sensitive tumor cells. The principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were employed for discovery of the changed lipids. This method, characterized by the simplicity and the speediness, demonstrated a new and promising approach for lipidomics study.Population versus hospital controls in the assessment of dietary intake of isoflavone for case-control studies on cancers in China. To assess dietary isoflavone intake between population and hospital outpatient controls and examine if cancer risks estimated for isoflavone using hospital outpatient controls would be different from those using population controls. Three parallel case-control studies on leukemia, breast, and colorectal cancers in China in 2009-2010 were conducted, using population and hospital outpatient controls to separately match 560 incident cases at a 1:1 ratio. A validated food frequency questionnaire was administered by face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The 2 control groups had closely similar distributions of dietary isoflavone intake. Risk estimates for breast cancers were adjusted ORs (95% CI) of 0.39 (0.23-0.66) and 0.31 (0.18-0.55) for daidzein, 0.35 (0.20-0.61) and 0.28 (0.16-0.52) for genistein, 0.66 (0.41-1.08) and 0.53 (0.32-0.88) for glycitein, and 0.53 (0.33-0.85) and 0.43 (0.26-0.71) for total isoflavone using hospital outpatient and population controls respectively. The study found that hospital outpatient controls were comparable to population controls in measured dietary intake of isoflavone in the Chinese hospital setting.'"

      "Anti-tumor-promotion by principles obtained from Angelica keiskei. Potent anti-tumor promoter activity has been found in the nonpolar extracts of the root of Ashita-Ba, Angelica keiskei Koidz. (Umbelliferae), which is eaten as a vegetable in Japan. From this active fraction, two angular furanocoumarins, archangelicin (1), 8(S),9(R 9-angeloyloxy-8,9-dihydrooroselol (2), three linear furanocoumarins, psoralen (3), bergapten (4), xanthotoxin (5),, three chalcones, 4-hydroxyderricin (6), xanthoangelol (7), a novel chalcone named ashitaba-chalcone (8), were isolated. Among these compounds, two angular type furanocoumarins, 1, 2,, three chalcones, 6-8, suppressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA stimulated 32Pi-incorporation into phospholipids of cultured cells, whereas coumarins 3-5 were less effective. In addition, chalcones 6, 7 were proved to have anti-tumor-promoting activity in mouse skin carcinogenesis induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz a anthracene (DMBA) plus TPA. Since chalcones 6, 7 showed calmodulin-interacting property, both chalcones may reveal anti-tumor-promoting activity via the modulation of calmodulin involved systems. These chalcones may be useful to develop the effective method for cancer prevention.Effects of catechins on the mouse lung carcinoma cell adhesion to the endothelial cells. We studied the effects of 5 kinds of catechins on the adhesion of mouse lung carcinoma 3LL cells to the monolayer of bovine lung endothelial cells. (- Epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin-3-gallate were active in inhibiting the 3LL cell adhesion, while ( catechin, (- epicatechin were inactive. (- Epigallocatechin showed a considerable cytotoxicity. These data suggest that the specific chemical structure is required to exert the inhibitory activity of catechins, the search for the cellular binding protein(s) bound to these inhibitory catechins would provide a clue to clarify the mechanism of interactions between tumor cells, endothelial cells.Evaluation of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor for potential chemopreventive properties in colon cancer. Epidemiological, laboratory studies indicate an inverse relationship between the risk of colon cancer development, intake of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, including aspirin. One of the mechanisms by which nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents inhibit colon cancer is through the inhibition of prostaglandin production by cyclooxygenase isozymes (COX-1, COX-2). Overexpression of COX-2 has been observed in colon tumors. Thus, selective inhibitors of COX-2 could potentially serve as chemopreventive agents. We have assessed the chemopreventive properties of SC-58635, a COX-2 inhibitor,, of sulindac, as a positive control, in a double-blind study, using azoxymethane-induced colonic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) as a measure of efficacy. Five-week-old male F344 rats were fed the control diet (modified AIN-76A) or experimental diets containing 150 or 1500 ppm SC-58635, 320 ppm sulindac, or 1500 ppm placebo. Two weeks later, all animals except those in vehicle (normal saline treated groups were s.c. injected with azoxymethane (15 mg kg of body weight, once weekly for 2 weeks). At 16 weeks of age, all rats were sacrificed, colons were evaluated for ACF. As expected, dietary administration of sulindac suppressed ACF development as such, reduced crypt multiplicity in terms of number of aberrant crypts focus. Administration of 1500 ppm SC-58635 inhibited total ACF induction, crypt multiplicity by about 40-49%. Our finding that SC-58635 significantly suppressed colonic ACF formation, crypt multiplicity strengthens the hypothesis that a selective COX-2 inhibitor possesses chemopreventive activity against colon cancer.Phase I study of E7010. E7010 is a novel sulfonamide which was discovered using slow-growing colon 38 carcinoma cells as a screening model. E7010 exhibits a broad spectrum of antitumor activity against human tumor xenografts. The mechanism of action is by arresting the progression of cells in M phase of the cell cycle by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. The objective of this phase I study was to determine the maximum allowable dose (MAD), toxicity,, pharmacokinetics of single or 5-day repeated doses of E7010. In the single-dose study, E7010 was administered orally to 16 patients at doses ranging from 80 to 480 mg m2. The dose-limiting toxicity was peripheral neuropathy at a dose of 480 mg m2. Hematological, gastrointestinal toxicities were mild. In the 5-day repeated-dose study, 41 patients were given E7010 at doses ranging from 30 to 240 mg m2 per day. The dose-limiting toxicities were peripheral neuropathy, intestinal paralysis. Gastrointestinal toxicity was dose-dependent but not severe. Hematological toxicity was not dose-dependent. Pharmacokinetic analysis in the single-dose study showed a rapid increase in the plasma levels of the drug after administration, followed by disappearance with a t1 2 of 4.4-16.6 h. The variation in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) between the patients was small, increased in a dose-dependent manner. Total drug recovery in urine 72 h after administration was 77.8 -11.4%, indicating that E7010 has favorable absorption, elimination profiles. The changes in the plasma levels of E7010 on day 5 in the 5-day repeated-dose study were almost the same as those on day 1, indicating that the drug did not accumulate. In the single-dose study, spinal cord metastasis exhibited a 74% reduction in a patient with uterine sarcoma, a minor response (MR) was observed in a pulmonary adenocarcinoma patient. In the 5-day repeated-dose study decreases in the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) were observed in a patient with stomach cancer, in a patient with recurrent uterine cervical carcinoma, respectively. The recommended phase II doses are 320 mg m2 for a single-dose study, 200 mg m2 per day for a 5-day repeated-dose study. Since the activity of E7010 is time-dependent, i.e. a certain concentration of E7010 is required for more than 12 h to suppress the growth of P388 leukemia cells, it is recommended that subsequent phase I II studies be conducted using a divided dose schedule in order to maintain the blood level of E7010.Studies on retinoids. IV. Design, synthesis, structure-activity relationships of di-t-butylphenyl compounds. Retinoic acid, its analogues play important roles in modulating cell growth, differentiation, immunity, apoptosis. Clinically they are used for cancer chemoprevention, chemotherapy. Based upon the moiety of 3,5-di-t-butyl-4-hydroxy phenyl ring, a series of substituted aromatic amide, ester, chalcones were designed, synthesized, which mimic the molecular shape, size,, spacial disposition of functional groups of retinoic acid. The general structure is as follows: formula: see text where R stands for hydrogen atom or methyl group, Y is the linkage -CONH-, -NHCO-, -COO-, -COCH = CH-, or a member of a heterocycle, X represents various substituents at different positions. The SAR indicates that the presence of hydrophobic group(s) at one end of the molecule,, a carboxyl group at the other end,, a conjugative system of molecule are necessary, full prerequisite for exhibiting activity. Loss of any one factor of them will abolish the activity. Being obligatory for anti-oxidative effect, the phenolic hydroxy group does not convey biological activity, because after methylation of the hydroxy group the compound increases the differentiation-inducing activity, loses the anti-oxidative effect, indicating that there is no correlation between the two activities. With a stable conformation of two phenyl rings with cis-conformation N-methylated acyl amide (No. 30) features in bent shape of the molecule, instead of an extended conformer, which is taken by the non-N-methylated partner, all-trans retinoic acid. A bent conformer of No. 30 accounts for the inactivity. In this paper compounds No. 4f, 4g, 5a, 7, 13, 32, 37,, 38 exhibited significant activity among them 4- 3-(3, 5-di-t-4-methoxyphenyl 3-oxo-1-propenyl benzoic acid (No. 38) showed high activity comparable to that of retinoic acid. The pharmacological action of No. 38 is under investigation.Genistein elicits pleiotropic molecular effects on head, neck cancer cells. Genistein (4,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone) has been reported to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis in different cancer cell lines in vitro, to show antitumor activity against a variety of tumors in animal models. We have previously reported that genistein induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis by up-regulating p21(WAF1), Bax,, down-regulating cyclin B1, Bcl-2 in a head, neck cancer cell line. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which genistein elicits its effects on head, neck cancer cells still remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we report that genistein induces several specific molecular changes in head, neck cancer cells, such as down-regulation of c-erbB-2 expression, down-regulation of MMP-2, MMP-9 secretion, inhibition of tumor cell invasion, down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB DNA binding activity. In addition, genistein inhibited the levels of phosphorylated Akt, the expression of 14-3-3 protein. Moreover, genistein induces telomere shortening in treated cells without affecting telomerase activity in vitro. We also observed that genistein inhibits the translocation of telomerase catalytic subunit human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) to the nucleus, which may result in telomere shortening, although the activity of telomerase is unaffected, along with the inhibition of metaphase spread of chromosomes. From these results, together with our previously published reports, we conclude that genistein elicits pleiotropic molecular changes that resulting in the inhibition of cell growth, the induction of apoptotic cell death of head, neck cancer cells, which suggests that genistein may be useful as a chemotherapeutic, or chemopreventive agent for head, neck cancer.Mechanism-based in vitro screening of potential cancer chemopreventive agents. Identification, use of effective cancer chemopreventive agents have become an important issue in public health-related research. For identification of potential cancer chemopreventive constituents we have set up a battery of cell-, enzyme-based in vitro marker systems relevant for prevention of carcinogenesis in vivo. These systems include modulation of drug metabolism (inhibition of Cyp1A activity, induction of NAD(P)H:quinone reductase (QR) activity in Hepa1c1c7 murine hepatoma cell culture), determination of radical scavenging (DPPH scavenging), antioxidant effects (scavenging of superoxide anion-, hydroxyl-, peroxyl-radicals), anti-inflammatory mechanisms (inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS mediated nitric oxide (NO) generation by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in Raw 264.7 murine macrophages, cyclooxygenase-1 (Cox-1) inhibition),, anti-tumor promoting activities (inhibition of phorbol ester-induced ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in 308 murine keratinocytes). We have tested a series of known chemopreventive substances belonging to several structural classes as reference compounds for the identification of novel chemopreventive agents or mechanisms. These include organosulfur compounds (phenethylisothiocyanate (PEITC), diallylsulfide, diallyldisulfide), terpenes (limonene, perillyl alcohol, oleanolic acid, 18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid), short-chain fatty acids (sodium butyrate), indoles (indole-3-carbinol), isoflavonoids (quercetin, silymarin, genistein), catechins (epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)), simple phenols (ellagic acid, resveratrol, piceatannol, curcumin), pharmaceutical agents (piroxicam, acetylsalicylic acid, tamoxifen),, vitamins derivatives (ascorbic acid, Trolox). We confirmed known chemopreventive mechanisms of these compounds. Additionally, we could demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by identification of hitherto unknown mechanisms of selected agents. As an example, we detected anti-inflammatory properties of PEITC, based on NF-kappaB-mediated inhibition of NO production. Further, PEITC inhibited phorbol ester-induced superoxide anion radical production in granulocytes,, ODC induction in the 308 cell line. These mechanisms might contribute to the chemopreventive potential of PEITC.Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits activation of HER-2 neu, downstream signaling pathways in human head, neck, breast carcinoma cells. Overexpression of the HER-2 neu receptor (HER-2) is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast carcinoma, also in patients with head, neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In a previous study on HNSCC cell lines, we found that epigalocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major biologically active component of green tea, inhibited activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), thereby inhibited EGFR-related downstream signaling pathways in HNSCC cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of EGCG on activation of the HER-2 receptor in human HNSCC, breast carcinoma cell lines that display constitutive activation of HER-2. Treatment of these cells with 10 or 30 microg of EGCG, respectively, doses that cause 50% inhibition of growth, markedly inhibited the phosphorylation of HER-2 in both cell lines. This was associated with inhibition of Stat3 activation, inhibition of c-fos, cyclin D1 promoter activity,, decreased cellular levels of the cyclin D1, Bcl-XL proteins. Although these concentrations of EGCG are quite high, we found that concentrations of 0.1-1.0 microg ml, which are in the range of plasma concentrations after administering a single oral dose of EGCG or a green tea extract, markedly enhanced the sensitivity of both types of cell lines to growth inhibition by Taxol, a drug frequently used in the treatment of breast carcinoma, HNSCC. These results, taken together with previous evidence that EGCG also inhibits activation of the EGFR in carcinoma cells, suggest that EGCG may be useful in treating cases of breast carcinoma, HNSCC in which activation of the EGFR, or HER-2 plays important roles in tumor survival, growth.Xenoestrogen-induced ERK-1, ERK-2 activation via multiple membrane-initiated signaling pathways. Xenoestrogens can mimic or antagonize the activity of physiological estrogens,, the suggested mechanism of xenoestrogen action involves binding to esr1s (ERs). However, the failure of various in vitro or in vivo assays to show strong genomic activity of xenoestrogens compared with estradiol (E2) makes it difficult to explain their ability to cause abnormalities in animal (and perhaps human) reproductive functions via this pathway of steroid action. E2 has also been shown to initiate rapid intracellular signaling, such as changes in levels of intracellular calcium, cAMP,, nitric oxide,, activations of a variety of kinases, via action at the membrane. In this study, we demonstrate that several xenoestrogens can rapidly activate extracellular-regulated kinases (ERKs) in the pituitary tumor cell line GH3 B6 F10, which expresses high levels of the membrane receptor for ER-alpha (mER). We tested a phytoestrogen (coumestrol), organochlorine pesticides or their metabolites (endosulfan, dieldrin,, DDE),, detergent by-products of plastics manufacturing (p-nonylphenol, bisphenol A). These xenoestrogens (except bisphenolA) produced rapid (3-30 min after application), concentration (10(-14 10(-8) M dependent ERK-1 2 phosphorylation but with distinctly different activation patterns. To identify signaling pathways involved in ERK activation, we used specific inhibitors of ERs, epidermal growth factor receptors, Ca2 signaling, Src, phosphoinositide-3 kinases,, a membrane structure disruption agent. Multiple inhibitors blocked ERK activation, suggesting simultaneous use of multiple pathways, complex signaling web interactions. However, inhibitors differentially affected each xenoestrogen response examined. These actions may help to explain the distinct abilities of xenoestrogens to disrupt reproductive functions at low concentrations.Effects of phenolics in Empire apples on hydrogen peroxide-induced inhibition of gap-junctional intercellular communication. The present study investigated antioxidant, antitumor-promoting activities of major phenolic phytochemicals of apples. The contents of each antioxidant in Empire apples was quantified, their contributions to total antioxidant activity of apples were determined using assay for inhibition of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced superoxide radical generation in cell culture model, expressed in vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC). The estimated contribution of major phenolics, vitamin C to total anitoxidant capacity of 100 g fresh Empire apples is as follows: quercetin (60.05 VCEAC) > chlorogenic acid (12.32) > phloretin (7.41) > procyanidin B2 (7.22) > vitamin C (6.61) > epicatechin (5.10) in superoxide radical scavenging assay. Recent reports suggest that the mechanism of carcinogenic process of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may be associated with the inhibition of gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), which is involved in tumor promotion process. Apple extracts showed the protective effects against the inhibition of GJIC by H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner. Quercetin exerted the strongest protective effects among major antioxidants in apples on H2O2-induced inhibition of GJIC, following epicatechin, procyanidin B2,, vitamin C, while chlorogenic acid, phloretin had no effects. Our results indicate that cancer chemopreventive activity of apples is associated with the combined antioxidant capacity, antitumor-promoting activities of diverse antioxidants.Low-dose dietary phytoestrogen abrogates tamoxifen-associated mammary tumor prevention. Wild-type erbB-2 neu transgenic mice were used to study the interactions between tamoxifen, dietary phytoestrogens (or isoflavones) by dose, form in vivo. Mice were randomized to one of four dietary formulas, implanted with an 8-week continuous-release tamoxifen or placebo pellet at 8 weeks of age. In placebo-treated mice, soy meal diet (but not diets supplemented with low-dose or high-dose isoflavones or a casein diet) resulted in prolongation of tumor latency. In tamoxifen-treated mice fed the soy meal, casein, or high-dose isoflavone enriched diets, the majority (>80%) showed no tumor formation by 60 weeks of age. Of the mice that developed tumors, latency was significantly prolonged. In tamoxifen-treated mice fed the low-dose isoflavone enriched diet, a much higher rate of mammary tumor development (>50% P < 0.002), a shorter tumor latency were observed. In vitro studies of human, mouse mammary tumor cell lines confirm that low doses of genistein, co-administered with tamoxifen, promote cell proliferation. This is in contrast to tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen with higher doses of genistein that are growth inhibitory. In summary, low-dose dietary isoflavones abrogated tamoxifen-associated mammary tumor prevention in vivo. These interactions are supported by in vitro data from human, mouse mammary tumor cell lines. These dose-associated interactions likely have relevance to the human use of tamoxifen for prevention or treatment of breast cancer.New anticancer agents: in vitro, in vivo evaluation of the antitumor, antimetastatic actions of various compounds isolated from medicinal plants. In this review, in the search for the development of new anticancer drugs, the effects of compounds isolated from various medicinal plants on tumor growth, metastasis, using mice bearing a highly metastatic drug-resistant mouse tumor, were studied. The antitumor, antimetastatic actions of stilbene derivatives isolated from Polygonum, Cassia species were examined. Among the stilbene derivatives, resveratrol, cassiagrol A (stilbene dimer) displayed antitumor, antimetastatic actions through the inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization in in vitro, in vivo models. It was found that two chalcone derivatives from Angelica keiskei roots also inhibited tumor growth, metastasis in tumor-bearing mice through the inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization, or the inhibition of immune suppression caused by tumors. Recently, basidiomycete fungi have been used for the treatment of cancer. Then, the low molecular weight substances were isolated from Agaricus blazei, Ganoderma lucidum as antitumor, antimetastatic substances. It is suggested that these substances of basidiomycete also inhibited tumor growth, metastasis to the lung through the inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization, or the inhibition of immune suppression caused by tumors.Celecoxib could reverse the hypoxia-induced Angiopoietin-2 upregulation in gastric cancer. We investigated the potential effect of Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) on hypoxia-induced Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) expression in gastric cancer cells. Our results revealed that hypoxia augmented Cox-2 , Ang-2 expressions. Also, the hypoxia-induced Ang-2 could be mimicked by CoCl(2) treatment while genestein treatment could partially counteract the hypoxia-induced Ang-2 expression. Celecoxib but not Cox-1 inhibitor sc-560 reversed the hypoxia-induced Ang-2 expression, while this effect could be partially restored by addition of exogenous PGE2. Our findings suggest that the hypoxia-elevated Ang-2 expression in gastric cancer cells may be mediated by both Cox-2-derived PGE2 , HIF-1alpha pathways, while celecoxib could counteract the hypoxia-induced Ang-2 expression.Prostate cancer has the third highest incidence of all cancers in men worldwide with incidence and mortality being particularly high in affluent, developed countries. Tea, especially green tea, has demonstrated promise in the prevention of several cancers. Green tea contains several components including catechins, a category of polyphenols that have chemopreventive properties. Although evidence from epidemiological studies is not comprehensive, it is strengthened by animal and in vitro evidence suggesting that consumption of tea is associated with decreased risk or progression of prostate cancer. Emerging evidence and potential biological mechanisms for the role of green tea in prostate cancer prevention are presented in this review.Combined inhibitory effects of green tea polyphenols, selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors on the growth of human prostate cancer cells both in vitro, in vivo. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors hold promise for cancer chemoprevention however, recent toxicity concerns suggest that new strategies are needed. One approach to overcome this limitation is to use lower doses of COX-2 inhibitors in combination with other established agents with complementary mechanisms. In this study, the effect of (-)epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a promising chemopreventive agent from green tea, was tested alone, in combination with specific COX-2 inhibitors on the growth of human prostate cancer cells both in vitro, in vivo. Human prostate cancer cells LNCaP, PC-3,, CWR22Rnu1 were treated with EGCG, NS398 alone, in combination,, their effect on growth, apoptosis was evaluated. In vivo, athymic nude mice implanted with androgen-sensitive CWR22Rnu1 cells were given green tea polyphenols (0.1% in drinking water), celecoxib (5 mg kg, i.p., daily, 5 days per week), alone, in combination,, their effect on tumor growth was evaluated. Combination of EGCG (10-40 micromol L), NS-398 (10 micromol L) resulted in enhanced (a) cell growth inhibition (b) apoptosis induction (c) expression of Bax, pro-caspase-6,, pro-caspase-9,, poly(ADP)ribose polymerase cleavage (d) inhibition of pparg, (e) inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB compared with the additive effects of the two agents alone, suggesting a possible synergism. In vivo, combination treatment with green tea polyphenols, celecoxib resulted in enhanced (a) tumor growth inhibition, (b) lowering of prostate-specific antigen levels, (c) lowering of insulin-like growth factor-I levels,, (d) circulating levels of serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 compared with results of single-agent treatment. These data suggest synergistic, or additive effects of combinatorial chemopreventive agents, underscore the need for rational design of human clinical trials.Combretastatin-chalcone hybrids: synthesis, cytotoxicity. A series of all-trans-1-aryl-4-aryl-5-aryl-2,4-pentanediene-1-one (3), a hybridized form of chalcone, combretastatin, was synthesized, evaluated against a panel of cancer cell lines, including B16, murine melanoma HCT116, colon cancer A431, human epidermoid carcinoma, human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC). Structure-activity relationships analysis of this series revealed that a 2,5-dihydroxyphenyl at position 1 of the 2,4-pentanediene-1-one was essential for cytotoxicity. all-trans-1-(2,5-Dihydroxyphenyl 5-(4-methoxyphenyl 4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl 2,4-pentanediene-1-one (3a) was the most potent compound from this series.Effects of acetylsalicylic acid , celecoxib on the N-nitrosodiethylamine induced carcinogenesis in rat liver , esophagus. The effects of nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (acetylsalicylic acid , celecoxib) on N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced carcinogenesis in the liver , esophagus were studied in rats. The inhibitory effect of celecoxib on carcinogenesis was more pronounced (in comparison with acetylsalicylic acid), which manifested in a significantly decreased incidence of neoplastic changes in the liver tissue (from 91.7 to 65.2%), number of tumors in the esophagus (from 4.13 to 2.61 tumor rat), , in delayed malignization in the liver , esophagus. The incidence of erosions , ulcers of the gastric mucosa was significantly lower after celecoxib treatment. These data indicate that celecoxib inhibits N-nitrosodiethylamine-induced carcinogenesis in the liver , esophagus.Comparative evaluation of antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, apoptosis inducing potential of black tea polyphenols in the hamster buccal pouch carcinogenesis model. To evaluate the relative chemopreventive efficacy of two black tea polyphenols, Polyphenon-B P-B , BTF-35 on 7,12-dimethylbenz a anthracene (DMBA induced hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcinogenesis. Hamsters were divided into 6 groups. The right buccal pouches of animals in groups 1-3 were painted with 0.5% of DMBA three times a week for 14 weeks. While hamsters in group 1 received no further treatment, animals in groups 2, 3 received diet containing 0.05% P-B, BTF-35 respectively, four weeks before DMBA painting that was continued until the end of the experiments. Animals in groups 4, 5 were given P-B, BTF-35 alone respectively as in groups 2, 3. Group 6 animals served as the untreated control. All the animals were sacrificed aftesr18 weeks. The expression of p21, cyclin D1, glutathione S-transferase pi (GST-P), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), Bcl-2, Bax, cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), cytokeratins, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was analysed by RT-PCR, immunohistochemical, Western blot analyses. DMBA treated animals developed buccal pouch carcinomas that displayed increased expression of p21, cyclin D1, GST-P, NF-kappaB, cytokeratins, VEGF, Bcl-2 with decreased expression of Bax, cytochrome C, caspase-3, caspase-9,, PARP. Dietary administration of both P-B, BTF-35 reduced the incidence of DMBA-induced HBP carcinomas by modulating markers of cell proliferation, cell survival, tumor infiltration, angiogenesis,, apoptosis. The results of the present study provide a mechanistic basis for the chemopreventive potential of black tea polyphenols. The greater efficacy of BTF-35 in inhibiting HBP carcinogenesis, modulating multiple molecular targets may have a potential role in the prevention of oral cancer.Colorectal cancer is the most abundant cause of cancer mortality in the Western world. Nutrition and the microbial flora are considered to have a marked influence on the risk of colorectal cancer, the formation of butyrate and other short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) possibly playing a major role as chemopreventive products of microbial fermentation in the colon. In this study, we investigated the effects of butyrate, other SCFAs, and of a number of phenolic SCFA and trans-cinnamic acid derivatives formed during the intestinal degradation of polyphenolic constituents of fruits and vegetables on global histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in nuclear extracts from colon carcinoma cell cultures using tert-butoxycarbonyl-lysine (acetylated)-4-amino-7-methylcoumarin (Boc-Lys(Ac)-AMC) as substrate. Inhibition of HDAC activity, e.g., by butyrate, is related to a suppression of malignant transformation and a stimulation of apoptosis of precancerous colonic cells. In nuclear extracts from HT-29 human colon carcinoma cells, butyrate was found to be the most potent HDAC inhibitor (IC50=0.09 mM). In the same assay, p-coumaric acid (IC50=0.19 mM), 3-(4-OH-phenyl)-propionate (IC50=0.62 mM) and caffeic acid (IC50=0.85 mM) were the most potent HDAC inhibitors among the polyphenol metabolites tested. Interestingly, butyrate was also the most potent HDAC inhibitor in a whole-cell HeLa Mad 38-based reporter gene assay. The findings suggest that butyrate plays an outstanding role as endogenous HDAC inhibitor in the colon.Xenoestrogens modulate vascular endothelial growth factor secretion in breast cancer cells through an esr1-dependent mechanism. Environmental chemicals may affect human health by disrupting endocrine function. Their possible role in the mammary gland, breast tumors is still unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key factor in angiogenesis, tumor progression, is an estrogen-regulated gene. We analyzed whether VEGF expression is regulated by different xenoestrogens in several breast cancer cells, MELN (derived from MCF-7), MELP (derived from MDA-MB-231), stably expressing esr1 (ERalpha) these cell lines stably express estrogen response element (beta-globin luciferase. Genistein, bisphenol A (BPA), 4-(tert-octyl)phenol (OP), dieldrin,, several phthalates, including benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), di-ethyl-2-hexyle phthalate (DEHP), were first shown to be estrogenic. These compounds induced a dose-dependent increase of VEGF secretion in MELN, MCF-7 cells maximal effect was observed at 1-10 microM non-cytotoxic concentrations, was inhibited by the antiestrogen ICI 182 780. VEGF increase was not observed in ERalpha-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. Most substances increased VEGF transcript levels in MELN cells. In contrast, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, vinclozolin,, the phthalates (mono-n-butyl ester phthalic acid, di-isononyle phthalate,, di-isodecyle phthalate) were ineffective on both VEGF secretion, estrogenic luciferase induction in these cell lines. Specific kinase inhibitors PD98059, SB203580, or LY294002 suppressed the xenoestrogen-induced VEGF response, suggesting activation of MEK, p38 kinase,, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase pathways. Our in vitro results show for the first time that genistein, xenoestrogens (BPA, OP, dieldrin, BBP,, DEHP at high concentrations) up-regulate VEGF expression in MELN cells by an ER-dependent mechanism. Since VEGF increases capillary permeability, breast tumor angiogenesis in vivo, the physiological relevance of these findings is discussed.Geraniin-mediated apoptosis by cleavage of focal adhesion kinase through up-regulation of Fas ligand expression in human melanoma cells. Geraniin, a form of tannin separated from geranium, causes cell death through induction of apoptosis however, cell death characteristics for geraniin have not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigated the mechanism of geraniin-induced apoptosis in human melanoma cells, demonstrated that geraniin was able to induce cell apoptosis in a concentration-, time-dependent manner. We also examined the signaling pathway related to geraniin-induced apoptosis. To clarify the relationship between focal adhesion kinase (FAK), geraniin-induced apoptosis, we treated human melanoma cells with geraniin, found that this resulted dose-, time-dependent degradation in FAK. However, FAK cleavage was significantly inhibited when cells were pretreated with a selective inhibitor of caspase-3 (Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO). Here, we demonstrated for the first time that geraniin triggered cell death by caspase-3-mediated cleavage of FAK. There were two possible mechanisms for activating caspase-3, mitochondria-mediated, receptor-mediated apoptosis. To confirm the geraniin-relevant signaling pathway, using immunoblot analysis we found that geraniin-induced apoptosis was associated with the up-regulation of Fas ligand expression, the activation of caspase-8, the cleavage of Bid,, the induction of cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol. Treatment with geraniin caused induction of caspase-3 activity in a dose-, time-dependent manner followed by proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase,, DNA fragmentation factor 45. The geraniin-induced apoptosis may provide a pivotal mechanism for its cancer-chemopreventive action.Epoxyquinol B shows antiangiogenic, antitumor effects by inhibiting VEGFR2, EGFR, FGFR,, PDGFR. Angiogenesis is the development of new blood vessels to provide oxygen, nutrients, is indispensable for solid tumor growth. Therefore, the inhibition of angiogenesis is an important modality for cancer chemotherapy. Here we report the antiangiogenic mechanism, antitumor effects of epoxyquinol B (EPQB), which was isolated from fungal metabolites. Short-term treatment of EPQB resulted in the reduction of tumor growth, the number of blood vessels directed to the tumor in a murine xenografts model. Furthermore, EPQB inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF induced migration, tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) without cytotoxicity. VEGF-stimulated phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), phospholipase Cgamma-1 (PLCgamma1),, p44 42 MAP kinases (ERK) was inhibited by EPQB in a dose-dependent manner,, in vitro assay using kinase domain of VEGFR2 showed that EPQB covalently bound, inhibited the VEGFR2 kinase. Its binding site on VEGFR2 was different from SU5614, a well-known VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor. Interestingly, EPQB inhibited growth factor-induced activation of not only VEGFR2 but also epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR),, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), suggesting that EPQB is a novel multiple kinase inhibitor. These findings suggest that EPQB would be a good lead compound for the development of potent antiangiogenic, antitumor drugs.Pretreatment with black tea polyphenols modulates xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in an experimental oral carcinogenesis model. The objective of this study was to evaluate the chemopreventive potential of the black tea polyphenols Polyphenon-B, BTF-35 during the preinitiation phase of 7,12-dimethylbenz a anthracene (DMBA induced hamster buccal pouch (HBP) carcinogenesis. Hamsters were divided into six groups. Animals in groups 2, 3 received diet containing Polyphenon-B, BTF-35, respectively, 4 weeks before carcinogen administration when they were 6 weeks of age, continued until the final exposure to carcinogen. At 10 weeks of age, animals in groups 1, 2,, 3 were painted with 0.5% DMBA three times a week for 14 weeks. Animals in groups 4, 5 were given Polyphenon-B, BTF-35 alone, respectively, as in groups 2, 3. Animals in group 6 served as control. All the animals were sacrificed after an experimental period of 18 weeks. Phase I, phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in the buccal pouch, liver were used as biomarkers of chemoprevention. Hamsters painted with DMBA showed increased expression of 8-OH-dG, enhanced activities of phase I (CYP450 total as well as CYP1A1, 1A2,, 2B isoforms, cytochrome b5), phase II (GST, quinone reductase) xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes with increased immunohistochemical expression of CYP1A1,, CYP1B1 isoforms in the buccal pouch. This was accompanied by increased phase I, decreased phase II enzyme activities in the liver. Administration of Polyphenon-B, BTF-35 significantly decreased tumor incidence, oxidative DNA damage, phase I enzyme activities as well as expression of CYP1A1, CYP1B1 isoforms, while enhancing phase II enzyme activities in the buccal pouch, liver. Our results provide a mechanistic basis for the chemopreventive potential of black tea polyphenols. Furthermore, the greater efficacy of BTF-35 in chemoprevention of HBP carcinomas via inhibition of oxidative DNA damage, modulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes may have a major impact in human oral cancer prevention.Mitochondria, PPARs,, Cancer: Is Receptor-Independent Action of PPAR Agonists a Key? Before the discovery of ppars (PPARs), it was well known that certain drugs considered as classical PPAR-alpha agonists induced hepatocarcinoma or peroxisome proliferation in rodents. These drugs were derivatives of fibric acid,, they included clofibrate, bezafibrate,, fenofibrate. However, such toxicity has never been observed in human patients treated with these hypolipidemic drugs. Thiazolidinediones are a new class of PPAR activators showing greater specificity for the gamma isoform of PPARs. These drugs are used as insulin sensitizers in the treatment of type II diabetes. In addition, they have been shown to induce cell differentiation or apoptosis in various experimental models of cancer. PPAR-alpha ligands have also been shown to induce cancer cell differentiation and, paradoxically, PPAR-gamma drug activators have been reported to act as carcinogens. The confusing picture that emerges from these data is further complicated by the series of intriguing side effects observed following administration of pharmacological PPAR ligands (rhabdomyolysis, liver, heart toxicity, anemia, leucopenia). These side effects cannot be easily explained by simple interactions between the drug, nuclear receptors. Rather, these side effects seem to indicate that the ligands have biological activity independent of the nuclear receptors. Considering the emerging role of mitochondria in cancer, the potential metabolic connections between this organelle, PPAR physiology, characterization of the reciprocal influences is fundamental not only for a better understanding of cancer biology, but also for more defined pharmacotoxicological profiles of drugs that modulate PPARs.Analyzing anti-cancer action mechanisms of dihydroartemisinin using gene chip. To understand the action mechanisms of artesunate on inhibiting leukaemia cell line K562 on the molecular level. The gene chip was used to detect the expression panel of genes of leukaemia cell line K562 treated by dihydroartemisinin. K562 cells were treated with 1 x 10(-5), 4 x 10(-5), 16 x 10(-5), 64 x 10(-5), 256 x 10(-5) mol x L dihydroartemisinin for 24 h,, then studied the modality changes by invert microscope. The morphological changes of the nucleons were observed by Hoechst33342 PI staining. The cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry analysis (FCM). Total RNA samples were obtained by TRIzol, were reverse transcribed to the cDNA. The cDNA samples were hybridized to our gene chips. Hybridization signal were collected, analyzed following scanning by Gene Pix 4100A. The numbers of drift cells were increased, the density of cells was decreased under invert microscope after K562 cells were treated with dihydroartemisinin for 24 h. Morphological changes of cell apoptosis such as karyopyknosis, conglomeration were observed by Hoechst 33342 PI staining. Flow cytometric analysis showed that cells were arrested in G2 phase. There were 13 differentially expressed genes identified. Hybridization analysis showed up-regulation of chk1, down-regulation of PCNA, cyclinB1, cyclinD1, cyclinE1, cdk4, cdk2, E2F1, DNA-PK, DNA-Topo I, mcl-1, jNK, VEGF in the dihydroartemisinin-treated K562 cells. Dihydroartemisinin can Inhibit the leukaemia cell line K562, exert its anti-cancer effect by altering the expression of these genes involved in cell cycle dihydroartemisinin may act via apoptosis pathway.Marine phosphatidylcholine suppresses 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced colon cancer in rats by inducing apoptosis. In vitro, animal studies indicate that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) suppress carcinogenesis. This study presents a new insight on effectiveness of marine phospholipids for suppression of colon cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate growth inhibition, apoptosis inducing effects of n-3 PUFA in the form of marine phosphatidylcholine (PC) on chemically induced (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) colon cancer in rats. Growth inhibition of Caco-2 cells was determined by colorimetric sodium 2-(4-iodophenyl 3-(4-nitrophenyl 5-(2,4-disulfophenyl 2H-tetrazolium (WST-1) dye reduction assay. For animal studies, the rats were fed 5 different diets containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA ethyl ester, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA ethyl ester, squid meal PC (rich in DHA), starfish PC (rich in EPA),, corn oil. The 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (30 mg kg) or saline was injected 48 hours before the experiment. Rats were anesthetized,, apoptotic as well as mitotic cells in crypt were counted based on morphological criteria in isolated crypts. Squid meal, starfish PC potently inhibited the growth of Caco-2 cells. The experimental diets containing n-3 PUFA suppressed colon cancer in rats. Rats that consumed diets containing DHA-ethyl ester, EPA-ethyl ester, squid meal PC,, starfish PC showed increased apoptosis (P < .01), suppressed proliferation. These results suggest that marine PC-containing diets might be an effective dietary protective factor against colon cancer.Transcription factor TFII-I causes transcriptional upregulation of GRP78 synthesis in prostate cancer cells. Receptor-recognized forms of alpha(2 macroglobulin (alpha(2)M*) bind to cell surface-associated GRP78, induce proliferative, survival signaling in prostate cancer cells. As part of the cellular response to alpha(2)M*, GRP78 expression is itself upregulated. In response to other stimuli, the transcription factor TFII-I upregulates GRP78 by binding to its gene promoter. We have, therefore, studied the role of TFII-I in transcriptional upregulation of GRP78 in 1-LN human prostate cancer cells stimulated with alpha(2)M*. This treatment caused a two- to threefold increase in TFII-I, GRP78 synthesis from (35)S -labeled precursor amino acids. Synthesis of both TFII-I, GRP78 were significantly reduced by silencing TFII-I gene expression or pretreatment of cells with genistein or actinomycin D. Confocal microscopy was employed to demonstrate relocation of TFII-I to the nucleus. In alpha(2)M*-stimulated cells, moreover, TFII-I bound to the GRP78 promoter as determined by CHIP assay. We also demonstrate binding of TFII-I to the c-fos promoter, consistent with its role in upregulating c-fos gene expression. In non-lymphoid cells, phosphorylated c-Src is an activator of TFII-I. Ligation of GRP78 on 1-LN cells with alpha(2)M* was followed by tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src as well as TFII-I. We conclude that alpha(2)M*-induced increase in GRP78 synthesis is caused by transcriptional upregulation of TFII-I which binds to the GRP78 promoter, thus potentiates its cell survival, antipoptotic functions in 1-LN prostate cancer cells.Vitisin A suppresses LPS-induced NO production by inhibiting ERK, p38,, NF-kappaB activation in RAW 264.7 cells. Vitisin A, a resveratrol tetramer isolated from Vitis vinifera roots, exhibits antioxidative, anticancer, antiapoptotic,, anti-inflammatory effects. It also inhibits nitric oxide (NO) production. Here, we examined the mechanism by which vitisin A inhibits NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Vitisin A dose dependently inhibited LPS-induced NO production, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression. In contrast, the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as tnf (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) was not altered by vitisin A. To investigate the signaling pathway for NO inhibition by vitisin A, we examined nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, an inflammation-induced signal pathway in RAW 264.7 cells. Vitisin A inhibited LPS-induced erk1 , erk2 (ERK1 2), p38 phosphorylation, suppressed LPS-induced NF-kappaB activation in RAW 264.7 cells. This suggests that vitisin A decreased NO production via downregulation of ERK1 2, p38, the NF-kappaB signal pathway in RAW 264.7 cells.Syntheses, potential anti-prostate cancer activities of ionone-based chalcones. We report the SAR studies of 43 ionone-based chalcones that demonstrate substantial in vitro anti-proliferative activities in LNCaP, MDA-PCa-2b, 22Rv1, C4-2B, PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. Compound 25 with an IC(50) value of 0.74 microM in LNCaP cells potently antagonizes DHT-induced transactivation of the wild type, the clinically relevant T877A, W741C, H874Y mutated androgen receptors, representing a novel chalcone as pan-antagonist of androgen receptor.Epigallocatechin gallate suppresses azoxymethane-induced colonic premalignant lesions in male C57BL KsJ-db db mice. Obesity, diabetes mellitus are risk factors for colon cancer. The activation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) IGF-IR axis plays a critical role in this carcinogenesis. (- Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major constituent of green tea, seems to have both antiobesity, antidiabetic effects. This study examined the effects of EGCG on the development of azoxymethane-induced colonic premalignant lesions in C57BL KsJ-db db (db db) mice, which are obese, develop diabetes mellitus. Male db db mice were given four weekly s.c. injections of azoxymethane (15 mg kg body weight), then they received drinking water containing 0.01% or 0.1% EGCG for 7 weeks. At sacrifice, drinking water with EGCG caused a significant decrease in the number of total aberrant crypt foci, large aberrant crypt foci,, beta-catenin accumulated crypts in these mice, all of which are premalignant lesions of the colon. The colonic mucosa of db db mice expressed high levels of the IGF-IR, phosphorylated form of IGF-IR (p-IGF-IR), p-GSK-3beta, beta-catenin, cyclooxygenase-2,, cyclin D1 proteins,, EGCG in drinking water caused a marked decrease in the expression of these proteins. Treating these mice with EGCG also caused an increase in the serum level of IGFBP-3 while conversely decreasing the serum levels of IGF-I, insulin, triglyceride, cholesterol,, leptin. EGCG overcomes the activation of the IGF IGF-IR axis, thereby inhibiting the development of colonic premalignant lesions in an obesity-related colon cancer model, which was also associated with hyperlipidemia, hyperinsulinemia,, hyperleptinemia. EGCG may be, therefore, useful in the chemoprevention or treatment of obesity-related colorectal cancer.Synthesis, biological evaluation of 3',4',5'-trimethoxychalcone analogues as inhibitors of nitric oxide production, tumor cell proliferation. A series of 23 3',4',5'-trimethoxychalcone analogues was synthesized, their inhibitory effects on nitric oxide (NO) production in LPS IFN-gamma-treated macrophages,, tumor cell proliferation has been investigated. 4-Hydroxy-3,3',4',5'-tetramethoxychalcone (7), 3,4-dihydroxy-3',4',5'-trimethoxychalcone (11), 3-hydroxy-3',4,4',5'-tetramethoxychalcone (14),, 3,3',4',5'-tetramethoxychalcone (15) were the most potent growth inhibitory agents on NO production, with an IC(50) value of 0.3, 1.5, 1.3, 0.3 microM, respectively. The tumor cells proliferation assay results revealed that several compounds exhibited potent inhibition activity against different cancer cell lines. The chalcone 15 was the most potent anti-proliferative compound in the series with IC(50) values of 1.8, 2.2 microM toward liver cancer Hep G2, colon cancer Colon 205 cell lines, respectively. 2,3,3',4',5'-Pentamethoxychalcone (1), 3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexamethoxychalcone (3), 2,3',4,4',5,5'-hexamethoxychalcone (5), 2-hydroxy-3,3',4',5'-tetramethoxychalcone (10), 11, 14 showed significant anti-proliferation actions in Hep G2, Colon 205 cells with an IC(50) values ranging between 10, 20 microM. Among the tested agents, compound 7 showed selective NO production inhibition (IC(50)=0.3 microM), while has no effect on tumor cell proliferation (IC(50) >100 microM). 3,3',4,4',5'-Pentamethoxychalcone (2) showed selective anti-proliferation effect in Hep G2 cells, in addition to its potent NO inhibition, however has no such response in Colon 205 cells. In contrast, 3-formyl-3',4',5'-trimethoxychalcone (22) showed moderate growth inhibition in Colon 205 cells, while has no such effect on NO production, Hep G2 cells proliferation. These results provide insight into the correlation between some structural properties of 3',4',5'-trimethoxychalcones, their in vitro anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer differentiation activity.Capsaicin displays anti-proliferative activity against human small cell lung cancer in cell culture, nude mice models via the E2F pathway. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by rapid progression, low survival rates. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents are urgently needed for this disease. Capsaicin, the active ingredient of chilli peppers, displays anti-proliferative activity in prostate, epidermoid cancer in vitro. However, the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin has not been studied in human SCLCs. The present manuscript fills this void of knowledge, explores the anti-proliferative effect of capsaicin in SCLC in vitro, in vivo. BrdU assays, PCNA ELISAs showed that capsaicin displays robust anti-proliferative activity in four human SCLC cell lines. Furthermore, capsaicin potently suppressed the growth of H69 human SCLC tumors in vivo as ascertained by CAM assays, nude mice models. The second part of our study attempted to provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin. We found that the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin is correlated with a decrease in the expression of E2F-responsive proliferative genes like cyclin E, thymidylate synthase, cdc25A, cdc6, both at mRNA, protein levels. The transcription factor E2F4 mediated the anti-proliferative activity of capsaicin. Ablation of E2F4 levels by siRNA methodology suppressed capsaicin-induced G1 arrest. ChIP assays demonstrated that capsaicin caused the recruitment of E2F4, p130 on E2F-responsive proliferative promoters, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that the anti-proliferative effects of capsaicin could be useful in the therapy of human SCLCs.Reversal of multidrug resitance by natural substances from plants. The multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins that belong to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MRP1, are present in a majority of human tumors, constitute an important cause of therapeutic failure. Selective inhibitors of the MDR-efflux proteins may improve the effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy. Their mechanism of action was believed to be a competition between resistance modifiers, drugs for the same binding site of P-gp. In our previous work we studied modulation of MDR in cancer cells expressing P-gp or MRP1 by selected carotenoids, flavonoids, extracts from medically important Chinese plants. Capsanthin, capsorubin, carotenoids isolated from paprika, were identified as potent P-gp inhibitors, while lycopene, lutein, antheraxanthin, violaxanthin induced moderate effects. Among flavonoids, effective modulators were rotenone, chrysin, phloretin, sakuranetin. Some chloroform extracts of Chinese herbs were also found to inhibit MDR efflux pumps. The effects of the modulators on P-gp activity were studied by measuring rhodamine 123 uptake in several cancer cells such as the human MDR1 gene-transfected mouse lymphoma cells (L1210), human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 expressing the MRP1 pump (HTB26). Additionally, the ability to alter biophysical properties of lipid bilayers by selected carotenoids was studied by differential scanning calorimetry. The antiproliferative effects as well as the MDR reversal activity of the studied compounds, applied in combination with anticancer drugs, were also discussed.Icariin derivative inhibits inflammation through suppression of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. In this study we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of an icariin derivative (3,5-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-6'',6''-dimethy1-4'',5''-dihydropyrano 2'',3'':7,8 -flavone). We found that this icariin derivative inhibits tnf (TNF-alpha) production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA expression,, protein expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. It also alleviates paw edema induced by carrageenan in mice. To clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying these anti-inflammatory effects, we examined the effects of this compound on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylation of inhibitory kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha),, nuclear translocation of p65 subunit of nuclear factor (NF kappaB,, found it suppresses the activation of p38 MAPK, inhibits translocation of NF-kappaB p65 to the nucleus through decreasing the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha. As a result of these properties, this icariin derivative can be considered as a potential drug for inflammatory diseases.Chalcones, dihydrochalcones augment TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Chalcones, dihydrochalcones exhibit chemopreventive, antitumor activity. TRAIL (tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a natural endogenous anticancer agent. We examined the cytotoxic, apoptotic effect of chalcones, dihydrochalcones on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. The cytotoxicity was evaluated by the MTT, LDH assays. The apoptosis was detected using annexin V-FITC by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy. The DeltaPsim was evaluated using DePsipher staining by fluorescence microscopy. Our study showed that two tested chalcones (chalcone, 2',6'dihydroxy-4'-methoxychalcone), three dihydrochalcones (2',6'-dihydroxy-4'4-dimethoxydihydrochalcone, 2',6'-dihydroxy-4'-methoxydihydro- chalcone,, 2',4',6'-trihydroxydihydrochalcone, called phloretin) markedly augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis, cytotoxicity in LNCaP cells, confirmed the significant role of chalcones in chemoprevention of prostate cancer.When considering methylxanthines and human health, it must be recognized that in many countries most caffeine is consumed as coffee. This is further confounded by the fact that coffee contains many bioactive substances in addition to caffeine; it is rich in phenols (quinides, chlorogenic acid, and lactones) and also has diterpenes (fatty acid esters), potassium, niacin, magnesium, and the vitamin B(3) precursor trigonelline. There is a paradox as consumption of either caffeine or caffeinated coffee results in a marked insulin resistance and yet habitual coffee consumption has repeatedly been reported to markedly reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes. There is strong evidence that caffeine reduces insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle and this may be due to a combination of direct antagonism of A(1) receptors and indirectly ?-adrenergic stimulation as a result of increased sympathetic activity. Caffeine may also induce reduced hepatic glucose output. With the exception of bone mineral, there is little evidence that caffeine impacts negatively on other health issues. Coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases or cancers and there is some evidence suggesting a positive relationship for the former and for some cancers, particularly hepatic cancer.Butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, suppresses cancer-induced osteoclastogenesis through inhibition of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand signaling. Osteoclastogenesis is associated with aging, various age-related inflammatory chronic diseases, including cancer. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) ligand (RANKL), a member of the tnf superfamily, has been implicated as a major mediator of bone resorption, suggesting that agents that can suppress RANKL signaling might inhibit osteoclastogenesis, a process closely linked to bone resorption. We therefore investigated whether butein, a tetrahydroxychalcone, could inhibit RANKL signaling, suppress osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL or tumor cells. We found that human multiple myeloma cells (MM.1S, U266), breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231), prostate tumor cells (PC-3) induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts, as indicated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP positive cells,, that butein suppressed this process. The chalcone also suppressed the expression of RANKL by the tumor cells. We further found that butein suppressed RANKL-induced NF-kB activation, that this suppression correlated with the inhibition of IkBalpha kinase, suppression of phosphorylation, degradation of IkBalpha, an inhibitor of NF-kB. Finally, butein also suppressed the RANKL-induced differentiation of macrophages to osteoclasts in a dose-dependent, time-dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that butein suppresses the osteoclastogenesis induced by tumor cells, by RANKL, by suppression of the NF-kB activation pathway.The polyphenol compositions of green tea (GT) and black tea (BT) are very different due to post-harvest processing. GT contains higher concentrations of monomeric polyphenols, which affect numerous intracellular signaling pathways involved in prostate cancer (CaP) development. BT polymers, on the other hand, are poorly absorbed and are converted to phenolic acids by the colonic microflora. Therefore, after consumption of GT, higher concentrations of polyphenols are found in the circulation, whereas after BT consumption the phenolic acid levels in the circulation are higher. The majority of in vitro cell culture, in vivo animal, and clinical intervention studies examine the effects of extracts of GT or purified (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on prostate carcinogenesis. These studies provide strong evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of GT, but results from epidemiological studies of GT consumption are mixed. While the evidence for a chemopreventive effect of BT is much weaker than the body of evidence with regard to GT, there are several animal BT intervention studies demonstrating inhibition of CaP growth. This article will review in detail the available epidemiological and human clinical studies, as well as animal and basic mechanistic studies on GT and BT supporting a chemopreventive role in CaP.Flavokawain B inhibits growth of human squamous carcinoma cells: Involvement of apoptosis, cell cycle dysregulation in vitro, in vivo. Flavokawain B is a natural chalcone isolated from the rhizomes of Alpenia pricei Hayata. In the present study, we have investigated the antiproliferative, apoptotic effect of flavokawain B (5-20 ??g ml 17.6-70.4 ??M) against human squamous carcinoma (KB) cells. Exposure of KB cells with flavokawain B resulted in apoptosis, evidenced by loss of cell viability, profound morphological changes, genomic DNA fragmentation, sub-G1 phase accumulation. Apoptosis induced by flavokawain B results in activation of caspase-9, -3, -8, cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), Bid in KB cells. Flavokawain B also down-regulate Bcl-2 with concomitant increase in Bax level, which resulted in release of cytochrome c. Taken together, the induction of apoptosis by flavokawain B involved in both death receptor, mitochondrial pathway. We also observed that flavokawain B caused the G2 M phase arrest that was mediated through reductions in the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, Cdc2, Cdc25C, increases in p21 WAF1, Wee1, p53 levels. Moreover, flavokawain B significantly inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-9, urokinase plasminogen activator expression, whereas tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were increased, which are playing critical role in tumor metastasis. In addition, flavokawain B treatment significantly inhibited in vivo growth of human KB cell-derived tumor xenografts in nude mice, which is evidenced by augmentation of apoptotic DNA fragmentation, as detected by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-meditated dUTP nick end-labeling staining. The induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis by flavokawain B may provide a pivotal mechanism for its cancer chemopreventive action.Gallic acid induces G??? G??? phase arrest, apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells through inhibiting cyclin D, E,, activating mitochondria-dependent pathway. Gallic acid (GA) induces apoptosis in different types of cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigate the apoptotic effects induced by GA in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells,, clarify the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that GA reduced the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose-, time-dependent manner. GA led to G(0) G(1) phase arrest in HL-60 cells through promoting p21, p27, inhibiting the levels of cyclin D, cyclin E. GA caused DNA damage, fragmentation in HL-60 cells as assayed using DAPI staining, Comet assay. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that GA increased Ca levels, reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential (?√å???(m)) in HL-60 cells. Apoptotic protein expressions were determined by Western blotting. The results indicated that GA-mediated apoptosis of HL-60 cells mainly depended on mitochondrial pathway, by promoting the release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), endonuclease G (Endo G), by up-regulating the protein expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), caspase-4, caspase-9, caspase-3. In addition, GA also activated the death receptor-dependent pathway by enhancing the protein expressions of fatty acid synthase (FAS), FAS ligand (FASL), caspase-8, BCL-2 interacting domain (BID). We determined the mRNA expression of the gene levels of these proteins by real-time PCR. The results showed that GA-mediated apoptosis of HL-60 cells mainly depended on up-regulation of the mRNA of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, AIF, Endo G. In conclusion, GA-induced apoptosis occurs through the death receptor, mitochondria-mediated pathways. The evaluation of GA as a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of leukemia seems warranted.A synthetic chalcone as a potent inducer of glutathione biosynthesis. Chalcones continue to attract considerable interest due to their anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic properties. We recently reported the ability of 2',5'-dihydroxychalcone (2',5'-DHC) to induce both breast cancer resistance protein-mediated export of glutathione (GSH), c-Jun N-terminal kinase-mediated increased intracellular GSH levels. Herein, we report a structure-activity relationship study of a series of 30 synthetic chalcone derivatives with hydroxyl, methoxyl,, halogen (F, Cl) substituents, their ability to increase intracellular GSH levels. This effect was drastically improved with one or two electrowithdrawing groups on phenyl ring B, up to three methoxyl, or hydroxyl groups on phenyl ring A. The optimal structure, 2-chloro-4',6'-dimethoxy-2'-hydroxychalcone, induced both a potent NF-E2-related factor 2-mediated transcriptional response, an increased formation of glutamate cysteine ligase holoenzyme, as shown using a human breast cancer cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter gene driven by antioxidant response elements.Curcumin inhibits tumor proliferation induced by neutrophil elastase through the upregulation of alpha1-antitrypsin in lung cancer. Lung carcinogenesis is a complex process in an unregulated inflammatory environment. Curcumin has been extensively investigated as a multi-target anti-tumor, anti-inflammation compound. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel inflammation-related mechanism for curcumin-induced inhibition of lung tumor growth. We found that neutrophil elastase, an important regulator of inflammatory processes, directly triggered tumor cell proliferation in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells,, curcumin could completely suppress the excess tumor proliferation induced by neutrophil elastase. alpha1-antitrypsin is synthesized by tumor cells, is the natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. We found that curcumin counteracted the decrease of alpha1-antitrypsin induced by neutrophil elastase by inducing the promoter activity of alpha1-antitrypsin, promoting its expression in A549 cells. The inhibition of neutrophil elastase-induced proliferation by curcumin was dependent on the PI3K Akt pathway. Knockdown of alpha1-antitrypsin by siRNA further enhanced the tumor cell proliferation induced by neutrophil elastase, significantly blocked the anti-proliferation effect of curcumin against neutrophil elastase. Curcumin remarkably inhibited the primary tumor growth of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) in C57BL 6 mice. We further showed that curcumin upregulated the level of alpha1-antitrypsin in primary tumor tissue by promoting its local expression,, the protein level of neutrophil elastase in tumor tissue was obviously decreased in mice treated with curcumin. Overall, our results suggest that neutrophil elastase, alpha1-antitrypsin play important roles in modulating lung tumor proliferation in inflammatory microenvironment, curcumin inhibits neutrophil elastase-induced tumor proliferation via upregulating alpha1-antitrypsin expression in vitro, in vivo.Secondary Metabolites from Plants Inhibiting ABC Transporters, Reversing Resistance of Cancer Cells, Microbes to Cytotoxic, Antimicrobial Agents. Fungal, bacterial,, cancer cells can develop resistance against antifungal, antibacterial, or anticancer agents. Mechanisms of resistance are complex, often multifactorial. Mechanisms include: (1) Activation of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as P-gp, which pump out lipophilic compounds that have entered a cell, (2) Activation of cytochrome p450 oxidases which can oxidize lipophilic agents to make them more hydrophilic, accessible for conjugation reaction with glucuronic acid, sulfate, or amino acids,, (3) Activation of glutathione transferase, which can conjugate xenobiotics. This review summarizes the evidence that secondary metabolites (SM) of plants, such as alkaloids, phenolics,, terpenoids can interfere with ABC transporters in cancer cells, parasites, bacteria,, fungi. Among the active natural products several lipophilic terpenoids monoterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes (including saponins), steroids (including cardiac glycosides),, tetraterpenes but also some alkaloids (isoquinoline, protoberberine, quinoline, indole, monoterpene indole,, steroidal alkaloids) function probably as competitive inhibitors of P-gp, multiple resistance-associated protein 1,, Breast cancer resistance protein in cancer cells, or efflux pumps in bacteria (NorA), fungi. More polar phenolics (phenolic acids, flavonoids, catechins, chalcones, xanthones, stilbenes, anthocyanins, tannins, anthraquinones,, naphthoquinones) directly inhibit proteins forming several hydrogen, ionic bonds, thus disturbing the 3D structure of the transporters. The natural products may be interesting in medicine or agriculture as they can enhance the activity of active chemotherapeutics or pesticides or even reverse multidrug resistance, at least partially, of adapted, resistant cells. If these SM are applied in combination with a cytotoxic or antimicrobial agent, they may reverse resistance in a synergistic fashion.Epigallocatechin-3-gallate induces mesothelioma cell death via H2 O2 -dependent T-type Ca2 channel opening. Malignant mesothelioma (MMe) is a highly aggressive, lethal tumor requiring the development of more effective therapies. The green tea polyphenol epigallocathechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits the growth of many types of cancer cells. We found that EGCG is selectively cytotoxic to MMe cells with respect to normal mesothelial cells. MMe cell viability was inhibited by predominant induction of apoptosis at lower doses, necrosis at higher doses. EGCG elicited H(2) O(2) release in cell cultures,, exogenous catalase (CAT) abrogated EGCG-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, necrosis. Confocal imaging of fluo 3-loaded, EGCG-exposed MMe cells showed significant Ca rise, prevented by CAT, dithiothreitol or the T-type Ca channel blockers mibefradil, NiCl(2) . Cell loading with dihydrorhodamine 123 revealed EGCG-induced ROS production, prevented by CAT, mibefradil or the Ca chelator BAPTA-AM. Direct exposure of cells to H(2) O(2) produced similar effects on Ca , ROS,, these effects were prevented by the same inhibitors. Sensitivity of REN cells to EGCG was correlated with higher expression of Ca(v) 3.2 T-type Ca channels in these cells, compared to normal mesothelium. Also, Ca(v) 3.2 siRNA on MMe cells reduced in vitro EGCG cytotoxicity, abated apoptosis, necrosis. Intriguingly, Ca(v) 3.2 expression was observed in malignant pleural mesothelioma biopsies from patients, but not in normal pleura. In conclusion, data showed the expression of T-type Ca channels in MMe tissue, their role in EGCG selective cytotoxicity to MMe cells, suggesting the possible use of these channels as a novel MMe pharmacological target. Xanthorrhizol induces apoptosis through ROS-mediated MAPK activation in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, inhibits DMBA-induced oral carcinogenesis in hamsters. Xanthorrhizol, a natural sesquiterpenoid compound isolated from Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb, has been known to inhibit the growth of human colon, breast, liver, cervical cancer cells. In this study, xanthorrhizol decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis, decreased the level of full-length PARP in SCC-15 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. A decrease in cell viability, PARP degradation was not prevented by treatment with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in xanthorrhizol-treated cells. Xanthorrhizol treatment elevated intracellular Ca, ROS levels in SCC-15 cells. Treatment with a Ca chelator, EGTA AM, did not affect xanthorrhizol- induced cytotoxicity, but cell viability was partly recovered by treatment with endogenous antioxidant, GSH, or hydroxy radical trapper, MCI-186. Furthermore, the viability of xanthorrhizol-treated SCC-15 cells was significantly restored by treatment with SB203580, or SP600125 but not significantly by PD98059 treatment. Xanthorrhizol-induced activation of p38 MAPK, JNK was blocked by MCI-186. Finally, xanthorrhizol suppressed the number of tumors in buccal pouches, increased the survival rate in hamsters treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz a anthracene. In conclusion, xanthorrhizol may induce caspase-independent apoptosis through ROS-mediated p38 MAPK, JNK activation in SCC-15 OSCC cells, prevent chemical-induced oral carcinogenesis. Therefore, xanthorrhizol seems to be a promising chemopreventive agent.Curcumin suppresses the TPA-induced invasion through inhibition of PKCalpha-dependent MMP-expression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a polyphenol derived from the plant turmeric (Curcuma longa), which is commonly used as a spice. Although anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation,, anti-angiogenic properties have been reported, the effect of curcumin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a major component in cancer cell invasion. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of curcumin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA induced MMP-9 expression, cell invasion, the molecular mechanisms involved in MCF-7 cells. Our results showed that curcumin inhibits TPA-induced MMP-9 expression, cell invasion through suppressing NF-kB, AP-1 activation. Also, curcumin strongly repressed the TPA-induced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, inhibited TPA-induced translocation of PKCalpha from the cytosol to the membrane, but did not affect the translocation of PKCdelta. These results indicate that curcumin-mediated inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression, cell invasion involves the suppression of the PKCalpha, MAPK, NF-kB AP-1 pathway in MCF-7 cells. Curcumin may have potential value in restricting breast cancer metastasis.Novel involvement of leukotriene B??? receptor 2 through ERK activation by PP2A down-regulation in leukotriene B???-induced keratin phosphorylation, reorganization of pancreatic cancer cells. Perinuclear reorganization via phosphorylation of specific serine residues in keratin is involved in the deformability of metastatic cancer cells. The level of leukotriene B??? is high in pancreatic cancers. However, the roles of LTB???, its cognate receptors in keratin reorganization of pancreatic cancers are not known. LTB??? dose-dependently induced phosphorylation, reorganization of Keratin 8 (K8), these processes were reversed by LY255283 (BLT2 antagonist). BLT2 agonists such as Comp A, 15(S HETE also induced phosphorylation of serine 431 in K8. Moreover, Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation, reorganization were blocked by LY255283. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed Comp A-induced K8 phosphorylation, reorganization in PANC-1 cells. Over-expression of BLT2 promoted K8 phosphorylation. Comp A promoted the migration of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner,, LY255283 blocked Comp A-induced migration, respectively. PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) suppressed Comp A-induced phosphorylation of serine 431, reorganization of K8. Gene silencing of BLT2 suppressed the expression of pERK,, over-expression of BLT2 increased the expression of pERK even without Comp A. Comp A induced the expression of active ERK (pERK), BLT2. These inductions were blocked by PD98059. Comp A decreased PP2A expression, hindered the binding of PP2A to the K8, leading to the activation of ERK. PD98059 suppressed the Comp A-induced migration of PANC-1 cells, BLT2 over-expression-induced migration of PANC-1 cells. Overall, these results suggest that BLT2 is involved in LTB(4 induced phosphorylation, reorganization through ERK activation by PP2A downregulation, leading to increased migration of PANC-1 cells.Effect of l-phenylalanine on PAL activity, production of naphthoquinone pigments in suspension cultures of Arnebia euchroma (Royle) Johnst. The effects of l-phenylalanine (PHE) on cell growth, production of shikonin, its derivatives, acetylshikonin (ACS), isobutyrylshikonin (IBS), in suspension cultures of Arnebia euchroma were examined. Supplementing media using PHE have been successfully utilized to enhance shikonin production in cell cultures of other species of Boraginaceae. l-Phenylalanine, the key compound in the phenylpropanoid pathway, is converted by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to trans-cinnamic acid, which is the precursor of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHB). Coupling of PHB, geranyl pyrophosphate (derived from mevalonate pathway) by p-hydroxybenzoate-m-geranyltransferase leads later to biosynthesis of shikonins. The addition of 0.01 or 0.1? mM PHE to the culture medium stimulated cell proliferation, where the highest observed increase in fresh cell biomass (measured as a ratio of final weight to initial weight) was 12-fold, in contrast to an eightfold increase in control cultures. Whereas, growth media supplemented with 1? mM PHE markedly reduced the rate of cell growth (to only twofold). Precursor feeding had detrimental effects on both ACS, IBS production in all PHE-supplemented media. The highest total content (intracellular extracellular) of the investigated red pigments (9.5? mg per flask) was detected in the control culture without PHE. ACS was the major component of the naphthoquinone fraction determined in cells, post-culture media. Shikonin itself was found only in the post-culture media from cultures supplemented with 0.01 or 0.1? mM PHE. Increases in PAL activity corresponded well with the accumulation of investigated naphthoquinones in control culture. However, peak PAL activity did not directly correlate with maximum production of shikonin derivatives. Cytotoxicity of extracts, prepared from the cells cultivated in the presence of PHE or in control cultures, was tested on three cancer cell lines: HL-60, HeLa,, MCF-7. The extracts prepared from the untreated control cultures proved to be the most potent against the examined cancer cell lines. The mean inhibitory concentration values were 0.3, 13,, 8? ??g? ml for the HL-60, HeLa,, MCF-7 cells, respectively.Glycolysis inhibitor screening identifies the bis-geranylacylphloroglucinol protonophore moronone from Moronobea coccinea. Tumor cells exhibit enhanced glucose consumption, lactate production even when supplied with adequate oxygen (a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, or aerobic glycolysis). Pharmacological inhibition of aerobic glycolysis represents a potential tumor-selective approach that targets the metabolic differences between normal, malignant tissues. Human breast tumor MDA-MB-231 cells were used to develop an assay system to discover natural product-based glycolysis inhibitors. The assay employed was based on hypersensitivity to glycolytic inhibition in tumor cells treated with the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitor rotenone. Under such conditions, ATP supply,, hence cell viability, depends exclusively on glycolysis. This assay system was used to evaluate 10648 plant, marine organism extracts from the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Open Repository. Bioassay-guided isolation of an active Moronobea coccinea extract yielded the new bis-geranylacylphloroglucinol derivative moronone (1). Compound 1 exhibited enhanced antiproliferative cytotoxic activity in the presence of rotenone-imposed metabolic stress on tumor cells. Surprisingly, mechanistic studies revealed that 1 did not inhibit glycolysis, but rather functions as a protonophore that dissipates the mitochondrial proton gradient. In the presence of rotenone, tumor cells may be hypersensitive to protonophores due to increased ATP utilization by the ATP synthase.Multifunctional albumin nanoparticles as combination drug carriers for intra-tumoral chemotherapy. Current cancer therapies are challenged by weakly soluble drugs, by drug combinations that exhibit non-uniform biodistribution, poor bioavailability. In this study, we have presented a new platform of advanced healthcare materials based on albumin nanoparticles (ANPs) engineered as tumor penetrating, delivery vehicles of combinatorially applied factors to solid tumors. These materials were designed to overcome three sequential key barriers: tissue level transport across solid tumor matrix uptake kinetics into individual cancer cells therapeutic resistance to single chemotherapeutic drugs. The ANPs were designed to penetrate deeper into solid tumor matrices using collagenase decoration, evaluated using a three-dimensional multicellular melanoma tumor spheroid model. Collagenase modified ANPs exhibited 1-2 orders of magnitude greater tumor penetration than unmodified ANPs into the spheroid mass after 96 hours,, showed preferential uptake into individual cancer cells for smaller sized ANPs (<100 nm). For enhanced efficacy, collagenase coated ANPs were modified with two therapeutic agents, curcumin, riluzole, with complementary mechanisms of action for combined cell cycle arrest, apoptosis in melanoma. The collagenase coated, drug loaded nanoparticles induced significantly more cell death within 3-D tumor models than the unmodified, dual drug loaded ANP particles, the kinetics of cytotoxicity was further influenced by the ANP size. Thus, multifunctional nanoparticles can be imbued with complementary size, protease activity features that allow them to penetrate solid tumors, deliver combinatorial therapeutic payload with enhanced cancer cytotoxicity but minimal collateral damage to healthy primary cells. Anticancer activity of flavonol, flavan-3-ol rich extracts from Croton celtidifolius latex. Croton celtidifolius Baill (Euphorbiaceae) is a tree found in the Atlantic Forest in Southern Brazil, where it is commonly known as Sangue-de-Drag??o. Its red latex is used traditionally for treating ulcers, diabetes, cancer. To evaluate antitumor activities of Croton celtififolius latex in vitro, in vivo. Phytochemical analyses were conducted using HPLC-DAD-MS. Cytotoxic, nuclease, pro-apoptotic properties were determined using the tetrazolium salt assay (MTT), plasmid DNA damage assay, ethidium bromide (EB) acridine orange methods, respectively,, antitumor activity was determined in the Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) mouse model. Phytochemical studies indicated a high phenol content of flavonols (45.67????????0.24, 18.01????????0.23???mg mL of myricetin, quercetin, respectively), flavan-3-ols (114.12????????1.84, 1527.41????????16.42???mg L of epicatechin, epigallocatechin, respectively) in latex. These compounds reduced MCF-7, EAC cell viability in the MTT assay (IC50???=???169.0????????1.8, 187.0????????2.2?????g mL, respectively). Latex compounds caused significant DNA fragmentation, increased the number of apoptotic cells (negative control (NC), 12% latex, 41%) as indicated by differential staining in the EB acridine orange assay. The in vivo latex treatment at 3.12???mg kg day reduced the body weight by 7.57????????2.04???g, increased median survival time to 17.5 days when compared to the NC group (13.0 days). In addition, the highest latex concentration inhibited tumor growth by 56%. These results agree with ethno-pharmacological reports showing cytotoxicity, antitumor activity of C. celtidifolius latex. The mechanism of antitumor action may be related to direct DNA fragmentation that reduces survival, induces apoptosis.6-Shogaol inhibits breast, colon cancer cell proliferation through activation of peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). 6-Shogaol has been shown to possess many antitumor properties including inhibition of cancer cell growth, inhibition of cancer metastasis, induction of apoptosis in cancer cells, induction of cancer cell differentiation. Despite its prominent antitumor effects, the direct molecular target of 6-shogaol has remained elusive. To identify the direct targets of 6-shogaol, a comprehensive antitumor profile of 6-shogaol (NSC752389) was tested in the NCI-60 cell line in an in vitro screen. The results show that 6-shogaol is COMPARE negative suggesting that it functions via a mechanism of action distinct from existing classes of therapeutic agents. Further analysis using microarray gene profiling, Connectivity Map analysis showed that MCF-7 cells treated with 6-shogaol display gene expression signatures characteristic of pparg (PPARgamma) agonists, suggesting that 6-shogaol may activate the PPARgamma signaling pathway for its antitumor effects. Indeed, treatment of MCF-7, HT29 cells with 6-shogaol induced PPARgamma transcriptional activity, suppressed NFkB activity,, induced apoptosis in breast, colon cancer cells in a PPARgamma-dependent manner. Furthermore, 6-shogaol is capable of binding to PPARgamma with a binding affinity comparable to 15-delta prostaglandin J2, a natural ligand for PPARgamma. Together, our findings suggest that the antitumor effects of 6-shogaol are mediated through activation of PPARgamma, imply that activation of PPARgamma might be beneficial for breast, colon cancer treatment.The role of phenolic compounds in the fight against cancer--a review. Cancer is a worldwide scourge it's the leading cause of death in developed countries, is increasing in developing countries. Mankind has been trying with effort to find better, cheaper treatments with fewer side effects, to reduce the incidence of the disease, its consequent mortality. For many years, phenolic compounds have been intensely studied for their antitumor, proapoptotic, antiangiogenic effects. In recent years, the usage of these compounds has increased considerably. This manuscript intends to structurally characterize the different phenolic compounds (flavonoids, hydroxycinnamates, hydroxybenzoates, coumarins, xanthones, chalcones, stilbenes, lignins, lignans), their metabolic pathways as well as review the most important results regarding these compounds, their derivatives in cancer treatment, prevention both in tumor cell lines in vitro, in murine models in vivo, finally some results regarding human trials. Identification of novel bioactive metabolites of 5-demethylnobiletin in mice. Biotransformation of dietary components is important for their in vivo biological activities after oral ingestion. Herein, we investigated biotransformation of 5-demethylnobiletin (a polymethoxyflavone found in citrus fruits) in mice,, its implication in the inhibition of human colon cancer cells. Urine samples were collected from mice fed with 5-demethylnobiletin (1), analyzed by LC-ESI-MS, HPLC coupled with an electrochemical detector. Three major metabolites were identified as 5,3'-didemethylnobiletin (2), 5,4'-didemethylnobiletin (3),, 5,3',4'-tridemethylnobiletin (4) by comparing their ESI-MS, HPLC profiles with those of authentic standards synthesized by a multistep route. Cell viability assay in human colon cancer cells demonstrated that all three metabolites of 5-demethylnobiletin, especially 5,3'-didemethylnobiletin (2), showed much stronger inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth than 5-demethylnobiletin. For example, metabolites (2-4) showed IC50 of 0.12, 5.5,, 4.2 ??M in SW620 cells, respectively, while 5-demethylnobiletin at 10 ??M only caused 37% inhibition after 72 h of treatment. Three novel metabolites were identified in mice after oral administration of 5-demethylniobiletin. These metabolites exhibited strong inhibitory effects against human colon cancer cells. Our results provide a first report on these bioactive metabolites, warrant further investigation on their molecular mechanism of actions.Antioxidant, pro-apoptotic effects of marine-derived, multi-mineral aquamin supplemented with a pine bark extract, Enzogenol,, a green tea extract, Sunphenon. A high dietary intake of polyphenols has been associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, attributed in part to their antioxidant activity, pro-apoptotic effects. Aquamin is a multi-mineral algal extract that enhances bone mineralization, relieves osteoarthritis,, aids digestion however, Aquamin has not demonstrated antioxidant activity. In the present study, Aquamin was supplemented with 8% Enzogenol, a pine bark extract with a high phenolic content,, 2% Sunphenon, a green tea extract that also has a high phenolic content to produce a mixed product (A:E:S). The antioxidant activity of A:E:S was compared with that of its constituent compounds, also with catechin, epigallocatechin by measuring total phenol content, ferric-reducing antioxidant potential,, 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate. The cytotoxic, apoptotic effects of the compounds were also measured in the U937, human monocytic blood cell line. A:E:S demonstrated an antioxidant activity that was equal to that of the compounds used in its preparation. A:E:S was cytotoxic, the primary mechanism of cell death was apoptosis. The biological effects of Aquamin were enhanced by supplementation with Enzogenol, Sunphenon to include antioxidant effects, the ability to induce apoptosis in U937 cells.6 -Gingerol Prevents Disassembly of Cell Junctions, Activities of MMPs in Invasive Human Pancreas Cancer Cells through ERK NF- k B Snail Signal Transduction Pathway. To study the effects of 6 -gingerol, a ginger phytochemical, on tight junction (TJ) molecules, we investigated TJ tightening, signal transduction pathways in human pancreatic duct cell-derived cancer cell line PANC-1. The following methods were utilized: MTT assay to determine cytotoxicity zymography to examine matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), paracellular flux for TJ measurement RT-PCR, immunoblotting for proteins related to TJ, invasion, EMSA for NF- k B activity in PANC-1 cells.   revealed that TER significantly increased, claudin 4, MMP-9 decreased compared to those of the control. TJ protein levels, including zonula occludens (ZO-) 1, occludin,, E-cadherin, increased in 6 -gingerol-treated cells, which correlated with a decrease in paracellular flux, MMP activity. Furthermore, NF- k B Snail nuclear translocation was suppressed via downregulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway in response to 6 -gingerol treatment. Moreover, treatment with U0126, an ERK inhibitor, completely blocked NF- k B activity. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that 6 -gingerol regulates TJ-related proteins, suppresses invasion, metastasis through NF- k B Snail inhibition via inhibition of the ERK pathway. Therefore, 6 -gingerol may suppress the invasive activity of PANC-1 cells. Role of adipokines, cytokines in obesity-associated breast cancer: therapeutic targets. Obesity is the cause of a large proportion of breast cancer incidences, mortality in post-menopausal women. In obese people, elevated levels of various growth factors such as insulin, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are found. Elevated insulin level leads to increased secretion of estrogen by binding to the circulating sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The increased estrogen-mediated downstream signaling favors breast carcinogenesis. Obesity leads to altered expression profiles of various adipokines, cytokines including leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-beta. The increased levels of leptin, decreased adiponectin secretion are directly associated with breast cancer development. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the tumor microenvironment promote tumor development. Efficacy of available breast cancer drugs against obesity-associated breast cancer is yet to be confirmed. In this review, we will discuss different adipokine-, cytokine-mediated molecular signaling pathways involved in obesity-associated breast cancer, available therapeutic strategies, potential therapeutic targets for obesity-associated breast cancer.Scientific validation of the medicinal efficacy of Tinospora cordifolia. Present communication reports the scientific evaluation of Tinospora cordifolia for its medicinal efficacy which includes phytochemical screening, antimicrobial, antioxidant,, anticancer activities of the plant. Secondary metabolites including anthraquinones, terpenoids,, saponins were present in many extracts in addition to phenolics. Total phenol contents in various extracts were found in the range of 8.75-52.50 catechol equivalent per gram (CE g). In disc diffusion assays, polar extracts exhibited considerable inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Several other extracts also showed antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains of E. coli, Pseudomonas spp.,, Proteus spp. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of potential extracts were found between 1.29, 22.73 mg mL. The lowest MBC (1.29 mg mL) was recorded for acetone, ethyl acetate extracts against K. pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp., respectively. The antioxidant activity of the extracts was comparable to that of standard antioxidants, concentration-dependent response was shown in reducing power assay. Aqueous extracts demonstrated substantial metal ion chelating activity (67-95%) at lower concentrations (10-40 ?? g mL). Other extracts also exhibited considerable metal chelating response. Most of the extracts revealed considerable inhibition of MCF-7 cancer cell line. The study established remarkable antibacterial, antioxidant,, anticancer potential in T. cordifolia stem extracts.Inhibition of IkB kinase-beta, IkB kinase-alpha by heterocyclic adamantyl arotinoids. We recently reported on a series of retinoid-related molecules containing an adamantyl group, a.k.a. adamantyl arotinoids (AdArs), that showed significant cancer cell growth inhibitory activity, activated RXRalpha (NR2B1) in transient transfection assays while devoid of RAR transactivation capacity. We have now explored whether these AdArs could also bind, inhibit IKKbeta, a known target that mediates the induction of apoptosis, cancer cell growth inhibition by related AdArs containing a chalcone functional group. In addition, we have prepared, evaluated novel AdArs that incorporate a central heterocyclic ring connecting the adamantyl-phenol, the carboxylic acid at the polar termini. Our results indicate that the majority of the RXRalpha activating compounds lacked IKKbeta inhibitory activity. In contrast, the novel heterocyclic AdArs containing a thiazole or pyrazine ring linked to a benzoic acid motif were potent inhibitors of both IKKalpha, IKKbeta, which in most cases paralleled significant growth inhibitory, apoptosis inducing activities.Licochalcone A suppresses migration, invasion of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells through downregulation of MKK4 JNK via NF-kB mediated urokinase plasminogen activator expression. Hepatocellular cell carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide, in Taiwan. Chemoprevention of cancer with dietary bioactive compounds could potentially reverse, suppress, or prevent cancer progression. Licochalcone A (LicA) is a characteristic chalcone of licorice, which is the root of Glycyrrhiza inflate. It had been reported that LicA has anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial,, anti-tumor properties. However, the effects of LicA on the migration, invasion of human HCC cells have not yet been reported. In the present study, it was found that LicA inhibits the migratory, invasion ability of SK-Hep-1, HA22T VGH cells in a dose-dependent manner, as assessed by the cell migration, Matrigel cell invasion assay. Using casein zymography, Western blotting, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,, an immunofluorescence assay, it was found that LicA induces a dose-dependent inhibition of uPA activity, expression, as well as reduces mRNA levels in SK-Hep-1, HA22T VGH cells. LicA was also found to inhibit the expression of phosphor-JNK, phosphor-MKK4 in SK-Hep-1 cells. Furthermore, LicA significantly decreased uPA levels in SP600125-treated or si-MKK4-transfected cells alongside a marked reduction in cell migration, invasion, which supports the notion that an inhibition of MKK4 JNK results in anti-metastatic effects. Moreover, LicA inhibited the expression of nuclear NF-kB, as well as the binding ability of NF-kB to the uPA promoter. These findings further our understanding of the role of LicA in suppressing tumor metastasis, its underlying molecular mechanisms, as well as suggest that LicA may be a promising anti-metastatic agent. Curcumin Regulates Colon Cancer by Inhibiting P-Glycoprotein in In-situ Cancerous Colon Perfusion Rat Model. Studies on p-glycoprotein was carried out world vide with cell lines like Caco2, MDR1-LLC-PK1, MDR1-MDCK in-vitro, but most of the results were failed to produce similar results in-vivo. In the present study curcumin inhibitory action on p-glycoprotein increased permeability of irinotecan, so in the colon cancer it would be beneficial if curcumin used as add on therapy. Intra-rectal administered of N-Nitroso N-methyl urea (2 mg Kg) induced colon cancer. Single pass whole length of colon in-situ perfusion was carried out in rats with irinotecan to study the influence of p-glycoprotein modulators like verapamil, curcumin. The rats were divided in to 5 groups (n=6), Group I served as control perfused with 30 ??g ml of irinotecan, propronolol, phenol red. Group II was cancerous group, induced by N-methyl N-nitroso urea. Group III was perfused with irinotican in cancerous rats. Group IV, perfused with irinotican in presence of verapamil, group V was pre-treated with curcumin, then perfused with irinotican, was estimated by HPLC-UV to effective permeability coefficient. Our qRT-PCR, Western blot results confirmed that about 15-fold decreases in the expression of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) in curcumin treated colon cancer cells. Irinotecan was increased to 0.00066 cm s, about 11-fold increase in verapamil-coperfused group, where curcumin pre-treated group irinotecan was increases 0.00006 cm s to 0.00042 cm s that is about 7-fold increase p-glycoprotein inhibitory activity by verapamil, curcumin found to be significantly enhanced the cancerous colon permeability of irinotecan. Any safe suitable p-glycoprotein inhibitors along with irinotecan will enhance the therapeutic benefit in the treatment of the colon cancer.Design, synthesis, biological evaluation of new inhibitors of Bax Bcl-xL interaction in cancer cells. We describe the synthesis of a series of new molecules containing phenol, triazoles moieties, compounds which have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit Bax Bcl-xL interactions in cancer cells, by using BRET assays,, to induce cell death. Several derivatives exhibit a very promising activity, being more potent than the reference compounds acylpyrogallol A, ABT-737. These preliminary results demonstrate that derivatives of this family can be attractive to develop new molecules with potent anticancer activity.Iso-suillin isolated from Suillus luteus, induces G1 phase arrest, apoptosis in human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells. Iso-suillin, a natural product isolated from Suillus luteus, has been shown to inhibit the growth of some cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms of action of this compound are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate how iso-suillin inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis in a human hepatoma cell line (SMMC-7721). We demonstrated the effects of iso-suillin on cell proliferation, apoptosis in SMMC-7721 cells, with no apparent toxicity in normal human lymphocytes, using colony formation assays, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of G1 phase-regulated, apoptosis-associated protein levels in iso-suillin treated SMMC-7721 cells. The results indicated that iso-suillin significantly decreased viability, induced G1 phase arrest, triggered apoptosis in SMMC-7721cells. Taken together, these results suggest the potential of iso-suillin as a candidate for liver cancer treatment. Hypoxia differentially regulated CXCR4, CXCR7 signaling in colon cancer. HIF-1alpha, CXCR4 CXCL12 have crucial roles in the metastatic process of colorectal cancer. Our aim was to study the significance of targeting HIF-1alpha, the CXCR4 CXCL12 axis in colorectal cancer to prevent the dissemination process in vitro. We investigated CXCR4, CXCR7 mRNA, protein expression in human colon carcinomas, the modulation of their expression by hypoxia, HIF-1alpha in colon cancer cell lines. The migration of tumor cells in a Boyden chamber was studied after CXCR4 inhibition with siRNA or the CXCR4 CXCL12 neutraligand, chalcone 4. Analysis of a cohort of colon polyps, chromosome-unstable carcinomas showed that the expression of CXCR4, CXCR7 was similar to that of the normal mucosa in the polyps, early-stage carcinomas but significantly increased in late stage carcinomas. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia strongly induced the expression of CXCR4 transcript, protein at the cell membrane, both regulated by HIF-1alpha, whereas CXCR7 expression was independent of hypoxia. After transient hypoxia, CXCR4 levels remained stable at the cell membrane up to 48? hours. Furthermore, reducing CXCR4 expression impaired CXCL12-induced Akt phosphorylation, whereas Erk activation remained unchanged. In contrast, reducing CXCR7 expression did not affect Akt nor Erk activation. In the presence of CXCR4 or CXCR7 siRNAs, a significant reduction in cell migration occurred (37%, 17%, respectively). Although irinotecan inhibited cell migration by 20% (p <0.001), the irinotecan, chalcone 4 combination further increased inhibition to 40% (p <0.001). We demonstrated, for the first time, that hypoxia upregulated CXCR4 but not CXCR7 expression in tumor cells, that the CXCR4 receptor protein level remains high at the cell membrane when the tumor cells return to normoxia for up to 48? hours. In addition we showed the interest to inhibit the CXCR4 signaling by inhibiting both the HIF-1alpha, CXCR4 CXCL12 pathway. CXCR4 seems to be a relevant target because it is continuously expressed, functional both in normoxic, hypoxic conditions in tumor cells.Polyphenols are responsible for the proapoptotic properties of pomegranate juice on leukemia cell lines. Pomegranates have shown great promise as anti-cancer agents in a number of cancers including clinical trials in prostate cancer. We have previously shown pomegranate juice (PGJ) induced apoptosis, preferentially alters the cell cycle in leukemia cell lines compared with nontumor control cells. However, the agents responsible have not yet been fully elucidated. Treatment of four leukemia cell lines with five fractions obtained from PGJ by solid phase extraction demonstrated that only the acetonitrile fractions decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in all leukemia cell lines. Acetonitrile fractions also significantly activated caspase-3, induced nuclear morphology characteristic of apoptosis. S phase arrest was induced by acetonitrile fractions which matched S phase arrest seen previously following whole PGJ treatments. The acetonitrile fractions contained higher phenol content than whole PGJ whereas only low levels of phenols were seen in any other fraction. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis demonstrated that acetonitrile fractions were enriched in ellagitannins, ellagic acid,, hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives but depleted in anthocyanins. Individual treatments with identified compounds demonstrated that the ellagitannin: punicalagin was the most active, mimicked the responses seen following acetonitrile fraction treatment. Bioactive components within pomegranate were confined to the acetonitrile fraction of PGJ. The enrichment in ellagitannins, hydroxycinnamic acids suggest these may provide the majority of the bioactivities of PGJ. Individual treatments with compounds identified demonstrated that the ellagitannin: punicalagin was the most active agent, highlighting this compound as a key bioactive agent in PGJTargeting esr1 subtypes (ERalpha, ERbeta) with selective ER modulators in ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer cells express both esr1 (ERalpha), ERbeta,, hormonal therapy is an attractive treatment option because of its relatively few side effects. However, estrogen was previously shown to have opposite effects in tumors expressing ERalpha compared with ERbeta, indicating that the two receptor subtypes may have opposing effects. This may explain the modest response to nonselective estrogen inhibition in clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of selectively targeting each ER subtype on ovarian cancer growth. Ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3, OV2008, expressing both ER subtypes, were treated with highly selective ER modulators. Sodium 3'-(1-(phenylaminocarbonyl 3,4-tetrazolium bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT) assay revealed that treatment with 1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl 4-methyl-5- 4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol -1H-pyrazole dihydrochloride (MPP) (ERalpha antagonist) or 2,3-bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl propionitrile (DPN) (ERbeta agonist) significantly suppressed cell growth in both cell lines. In contrast, 4,4',4???-(4-propyl- 1H -pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) (ERalpha agonist) or 4- 2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo 1,5-a -pyrimidin-3-yl phenol (PHTPP) (ERbeta antagonist) significantly enhanced cell growth. These results were confirmed on a xenograft model where SKOV3 cells were injected s.c. into ovariectomized mice. We observed that the average size of xenografts in both the DPN-treated group, the MPP-treated group was significantly smaller than that for the vehicle-treated group. In addition, we found that phospho-AKT expressions in SKOV3 cells were reduced by 80% after treatment with MPP, DPN, indicating that the AKT pathway was involved. The combined treatment with MPP, DPN had a synergistic effect in suppressing ovarian cancer cell growth. Our findings indicate that targeting ER subtypes may enhance the response to hormonal treatment in women with ovarian cancer. Quinoxaline-substituted chalcones as new inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein ABCG2: polyspecificity at B-ring position. A series of chalcones substituted by a quinoxaline unit at the B-ring were synthesized, tested as inhibitors of breast cancer resistance protein-mediated mitoxantrone efflux. These compounds appeared more efficient than analogs containing other B-ring substituents such as 2-naphthyl or 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl while an intermediate inhibitory activity was obtained with a 1-naphthyl group. In all cases, two or three methoxy groups had to be present on the phenyl A-ring to produce a maximal inhibition. Molecular modeling indicated both electrostatic, steric positive contributions. A higher potency was observed when the 2-naphthyl or 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl group was shifted to the A-ring, methoxy substituents were shifted to the phenyl B-ring, indicating preferences among polyspecificity of inhibition. Trilobatin attenuates the LPS-mediated inflammatory response by suppressing the NF-kB signaling pathway. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of trilobatin, the flavonoid isolated from the leaves of Lithocarpus polystachyus Rehd, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. Treatment with trilobatin (0.005-5 ??M) dose-dependently inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS induced mRNA expression, secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tnf (TNFalpha), interleukin-beta (IL-beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), in RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, no further inhibition was detected when the concentration of trilobatin was increased to 50 ??M. Western blot analysis confirmed that the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory effect was correlated with the inhibition of LPS-induced inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IkBalpha) degradation, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) p65 phosphorylation. In addition, trilobatin also showed a significant inhibition of LPS-induced TNFalpha, IL-6 at both the mRNA, protein levels in a mouse model. Our results suggest that trilobatin potentially inhibits the LPS-induced inflammatory response by suppressing the NF-kB signaling pathway. Pterostilbene suppresses oral cancer cell invasion by inhibiting MMP-2 expression. Polyphenol compounds, present in a wide variety of natural plants, exhibit antioxidant, free radical scavenging ability, induce apoptosis in various cancer cells. However, the effect of pterostilbene on oral cancer cell metastasis has not been clarified. The present study aimed to examine the anti-metastatic properties of pterostilbene in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC 9 cells. In this study, pterostilbene treatment significantly inhibited migration invasion capacities of SCC-9 cells in vitro. The results of zymography, western blotting revealed that the activities, protein levels of the MMP-2, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) was inhibited by pterostilbene. Western blot analysis also showed that pterostilbene inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt, erk1 , erk2, p38. Determinations of the mRNA levels, real-time polymerase chain reaction, promoter assays were conducted to evaluate the inhibitory effects of pterostilbene on MMP-2, u-PA expression in SCC-9 cells. Such inhibitory effects were associated with the upregulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, the downregulation of the transcription factors of NF-kB, SP-1, CREB signaling pathways. Pterostilbene may have potential use as a chemopreventive agent against oral cancer metastasis.A natural androgen receptor antagonist induces cellular senescence in prostate cancer cells. We have previously identified a natural occurring, androgen receptor-specific antagonist. Atraric acid (AA) inhibits the transactivation of the androgen receptor (AR), androgen-mediated growth of AR-expressing human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines. Here we show that AA treatment of living cells provokes molecular changes of AR signaling. In addition to a deceleration of nuclear translocation a block of the intramolecular amino carboxy (N C terminal interaction of the AR was observed. Furthermore, using high-resolution confocal fluorescence microscopy, a reduced speckle formation of the AR was observed in line with an increased intranuclear mobility of the receptor. This suggests decreased DNA binding of the AR, which is further indicated by an impaired chromatin recruitment of the AR to the prostate-specific antigen promoter, enhancer shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments. Using inhibitors of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src or Akt, known interaction partners of AR, reduced the level of androgen-induced cellular senescence suggesting a partly non-genomic pathway to induce cellular senescence by AA. Using PP2 (4-Amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl 7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo 3,4-d pyrimidine) pyrimidine or Akt inhibitors, inhibitors of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src or Akt, known interaction partners of AR, reduced the level of androgen-induced cellular senescence, suggesting a partly nongenomic pathway to induce cellular senescence by AA. Treatment of LNCaP cells with AA is associated with hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor, an increase of p16 expression, whereas the p53-p21 signaling pathway seems not be affected by AA treatment. Analyzing human PCa tissue samples treated with AA ex vivo also indicates an induction of cellular senescence associated with an increase of p16 expression but not p21. Taken together, these data indicate that AA exhibits novel features to inhibit AR amino carboxy-terminal interaction, the AR-mediated nuclear activities, growth of PCa cells.Fatty acid esters of phloridzin induce apoptosis of human liver cancer cells through altered gene expression. Phloridzin (phlorizin or phloretin 2'-O-glucoside) is known for blocking intestinal glucose absorption. We have investigated the anticarcinogenic effect of phloridzin, its novel derivatives using human cancer cell lines. We have synthesised novel acylated derivatives of phloridzin with six different long chain fatty acids by regioselective enzymatic acylation using Candida Antarctica lipase B. The antiproliferative effects of the new compounds were investigated in comparison with the parent compounds, phloridzin, aglycone phloretin, the six free fatty acids, chemotherapeutic drugs (sorafenib, doxorubicin, daunorubicin) using human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells, human breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, acute monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells along with normal human, rat hepatocytes. The fatty acid esters of phloridzin inhibited significantly the growth of the two carcinoma, leukemia cells while similar treatment doses were not toxic to normal human or rat hepatocytes. The antiproliferative potency of fatty esters of phloridzin was comparable to the potency of the chemotherapeutic drugs. The fatty acid esters of phloridzin inhibited DNA topoisomerases IIalpha activity that might induce G0 G1 phase arrest, induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3,, decreased ATP level, mitochondrial membrane potential in HepG2 cells. Based on the high selectivity on cancer cells, decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ester of phloridzin was selected for gene expression analysis using RT2PCR human cancer drug target array. Antiproliferative effect of DHA ester of phloridzin could be related to the down regulation of anti-apoptotic gene (BCL2), growth factor receptors (EBFR family, IGF1R IGF2, PDGFR), its downstream signalling partners (PI3k AKT mTOR, Ras Raf MAPK), cell cycle machinery (CDKs, TERT, TOP2A, TOP2B) as well as epigenetics regulators (HDACs). These results suggest that fatty esters of phloridzin have potential chemotherapeutic effects mediated through the attenuated expression of several key proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA topoisomerases IIalpha activity, epigenetic mechanisms followed by cell cycle arrest, apoptosis. Studies of synthetic chalcone derivatives as potential inhibitors of secretory phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenase, pro-inflammatory cytokines. Arachidonic acid metabolism leads to the generation of key lipid mediators which play a fundamental role during inflammation. The inhibition of enzymes involved in arachidonic acid metabolism has been considered as a synergistic anti-inflammatory effect with enhanced spectrum of activity. A series of 1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-one derivatives were investigated for anti-inflammatory related activities involving inhibition of secretory phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenases, soybean lipoxygenase,, lipopolysaccharides-induced secretion of interleukin-6, tnf in mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. The results from the above mentioned assays exhibited that the synthesized compounds were effective inhibitors of pro-inflammatory enzymes, cytokines. The results also revealed that the chalcone derivatives with 4-methlyamino ethanol substitution seem to be significant for inhibition of enzymes, cytokines. Molecular docking experiments were carried out to elucidate the molecular aspects of the observed inhibitory activities of the investigated compounds. Present findings increase the possibility that these chalcone derivatives might serve as a beneficial starting point for the design, development of improved anti-inflammatory agents. Verbascoside promotes apoptosis by regulating HIPK2-p53 signaling in human colorectal cancer. We investigated the role of the HIPK2-p53 signaling pathway in tumorigenesis, resistance to the drug Verbascoside (VB) in colorectal cancer (CRC), using in vivo, in vitro experiments. Primary human CRC samples, normal intestinal tissues from patients were analyzed for HIPK2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), its expression was correlated against patients' clinicopathological characteristics. Human CRC HCT-116 cells were implanted in BALB c nude mice mice with xenografted tumors were randomly administrated vehicle (control), 20, 40, or 80 mg mL VB, or 1 mg mL fluorouracil (5-FU). HIPK2, p53, Bax,, Bcl-2 expression in these tumors were determined by IHC. In vitro effects of VB on CRC cell proliferation, apoptosis were measured by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry HIPK2, p53, p-p53, Bax,, Bcl-2 were measured by western blot. IHC analysis for 100 human CRC tumor samples, 20 normal intestinal tissues, showed HIPK2 expression to inversely correlate with Dukes stage, depth of invasion in CRC (P<0.05). In vivo, the inhibition rates of 20, 40,, 80 mg mL VB on CRC xenograft tumor weight were 42.79%, 53.90%,, 60.99%, respectively,, were accompanied by increased expression of HIPK2, p53,, Bax,, decreased Bcl-2 expression in treated tumors. In vitro, VB significantly inhibited proliferation of CRC cell lines HCT-116, HT-29, LoVo,, SW620, in a time-, dose-dependent manner. The apoptosis rates of 25, 50,, 100 ??M VB on HCT-116 cells were 10.83??1.28, 11.25??1.54,, 20.19??2.87%,, on HT-29 cells were 18.92??6.12, 21.57??4.05,, 25.14??6.73%, respectively. In summary, VB treatment significantly enhanced the protein expression of pro-apoptotic HIPK2, p53, p-p53, Bax,, decreased anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression in CRC cells. HIPK2 protein modulates the phosphorylation status of p53,, levels of Bax, Bcl-2 in CRC. We also found that VB effectively activated the HIPK2-p53 signaling pathway, resulting in increased CRC cell apoptosis.Natural daucane esters induces apoptosis in leukaemic cells through ROS production. Continuing our research on antiproliferative agents from plants, we extended our interest on further compounds isolated from Ferula communis, Ferulago campestris. One new daucane (DE-20), one new phenol derivative (PH-3) were isolated, characterized in addition to six daucane, three coumarins, four simple phenolics. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated against a panel of six human tumor cell lines. The derivative DE-17 that resulted moderately active on all the studied cell lines was studied to evaluate its possible mechanism of action. DE-17 was able to induce apoptosis in a time, concentration-dependent manner in SEM, Jurkat cell lines. We observed that DE-17 just aftesr1h of treatment increased the ros (ROS) production, that the co-incubation of DE-17 with ROS scavengers significantly increased cell viability suggesting that ROS-mediated downstream signaling is essential for the antiproliferative effects of DE-17. At later times of incubation DE-17 induced mitochondrial depolarization, as well as caspase-3, -9 activation suggesting that apoptosis follow the mitochondrial pathway. Concomitantly to ROS induction, a remarkable decrease of mRNA expression of several antioxidant enzymes, intracellular GSH content was detected in treated cells compared to controls further indicative of oxidative stress. Taken together our results showed for the first time that daucane esters induces apoptotic cell death through a ROS-mediated mechanism in human leukemia cells.Novel chalcone derivatives as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF 1 inhibitor: synthesis, anti-invasive, anti-angiogenic properties. A novel series of chalcone derivatives were synthesized, their biological activities against HIF-1 were evaluated. Among these compounds, 5d exhibited clearly inhibitory effects on HIF-1 by downregulating the expression of HIF-1alpha under hypoxic conditions. Meanwhile, it also significantly suppressed VEGF-induced migration, invasion of Hep3B, HUVEC cells in nontoxic concentrations. Additionally, tube formation assay demonstrated its anti-angiogenesis activity. Moreover, the in? vivo study indicated that compound 5d could retard tumor growth of Hep3B xenograft models, reduced CD31, MMP-2 expression in tumor tissues. Finally, in acute intravenous toxicity, 5d was well tolerated, was found to be non-toxic up to 200? mg kg in Swiss mice. These findings support the further investigation on the anti-invasive, anti-angiogenic potential of this class of compounds as HIF-1 inhibitor. Anthraquinone-chalcone hybrids: synthesis, preliminary antiproliferative evaluation, DNA-interaction studies. Novel anthraquinone based chalcone compounds were synthesized starting from 1-acetylanthraquinone in a Claisen-Schmidt reaction, evaluated for their anticancer potential against three human cancer cell lines. Compounds 4a, 4b, 4j showed promising activity in inhibition of HeLa cells with IC50 values ranging from 2.36 to 2.73 ??M, low cytotoxicity against healthy MRC-5 cell lines. The effects that compounds produces on the cell cycle were investigated by flow cytometry. It was found that 4a, 4b, 4j cause the accumulation of cells in the S, G2 M phases in a dose-dependent manner, induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. All of three compounds exhibit calf thymus DNA-binding activity. The determined binding constants by absorption titrations (2.65 ?? 10(3) M, 1.36 ?? 10(3) Mand 2.51 ?? 10(3) M of 4a CT-DNA, 4b CT-DNA, 4j CT-DNA, respectively) together with fluorescence displacement analysis designate 4a, 4b, 4j as strong minor groove binders.2-Hydroxy-3,4-naphthochalcone (2H-NC) inhibits TNFalpha-induced tumor invasion through the downregulation of NF-kB-mediated MMP-9 gene expression. The control of tumor metastasis is important for the successful prevention, treatment of cancer. Emerging evidence indicates that various natural, synthetic chalcones exhibit antimetastatic activity through the inhibition of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), although the precise mechanism by which this occurs is currently unclear. In this study, 2-hydroxy-3,4-naphthochalcone (2H-NC) was found to reduce tnf (TNFalpha induced MMP-9 mRNA expression, gelatinolytic enzyme activity. These actions were associated with inhibition of RelA p65 NF-kB activity. In addition, 2H-NC inhibited TNFalpha-induced invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, as assessed using a three-dimensional spheroid invasion assay. Taken together, these data demonstrate that 2H-NC prevents TNFalpha-induced tumor cell invasion through downregulation of NF-kB-mediated MMP-9 gene expression,, thereby identify naphthochalcones as a potentially effective class of molecules to use as a platform for the development of antimetastatic agents.Estradiol agonists inhibit human LoVo colorectal-cancer cell proliferation, migration through p53. To investigate the effects of 17beta-estradiol via esr1s (ER) or direct administration of ER agonists on human colorectal cancer. LoVo cells were established from the Bioresource Collection, Research Center, cultured in phenol red-free DMEM (Sigma, United States). To investigate the effects of E2, or ER selective agonists on cellular proliferation, LoVo colorectal cells were treated with E2 or ER-selective agonists for 24 h, 48 h, subjected to the MTT (Sigma) assay to find the concentration. And investigate the effects of E2, or ER selective agonists on cell used western immunoblotting to find out the diversification of signaling pathways. In order to observe motility, migration the wound healing assay, a transwell chamber (Neuro Probe) plate were tased. For a quantitative measure, we counted the number of migrating cells to the wound area post-wounding for 24 h. We further examined the cellular migration-regulating factors urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP 9 in human LoVo cells so gelatin zymography that we used, gelatinolytic activity was visualized by Coomassie blue staining. And these results are presented as means ?? SE,, statistical comparisons were made using Student's t-test. The structure was first compared with E2, ER agonists. We then treated the LoVo cells with E2, ER agonists (10(-8) mol L) for 24 h, 48 h, subsequently measured the cell viability using MTT assay. Our results showed that treatment with 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonists in human LoVo colorectal cancer cells activated p53, then up-regulated p21, p27 protein levels, subsequently inhibiting the downstream target gene, cyclin D1, which regulates cell proliferation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the anti-tumorigenesis effects of 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonists, suggest that these compounds may prove to be a potential alternative therapy in the treatment of human colorectal cancer. These results demonstrate that 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonists downregulate migration-related proteins through the p53 signaling pathway in human LoVo colorectal cancer cells. These findings suggest that p53 plays a critical role in the 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonist-mediated protective activity against colorectal cancer progression. In addition, 17beta-estradiol, or ER agonists dramatically inhibited cell migration, reduced the expression of u-PA, t-PA, MMP-9 as well as MMP-2 9 activity in LoVo cells, which regulate cell metastasis. Moreover, we observed that pretreatment with a p53 inhibitor significantly blocked the anti-migration effects of E2, or ER agonists on LoVo cells. That E2, or ER agonists may impair LoVo cell migration by modulating migration-related factors via the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Direct ER treatment may prove to be an attractive alternative therapy in the treatment of human colorectal tumors in the future.Phenolic, carotenoid profiles, antiproliferative activity of foxtail millet. Commonly consumed foxtail millet varieties Jingu28, Jingu34 were compared in terms of phytochemical composition, antioxidant property,, antiproliferative activity. The cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) was evaluated based on HepG2 cell cultivation. Antiproliferative properties against HepG2, MDA cell were assayed by methylene blue assay. Total phenolic content (TPC) was 78.79, 114.22 mg gallic acid equiv 100 g DW in Jingu28, Jingu34. Both varieties contained ferulic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, syringic acid. Xanthophylls, zeaxanthin were also detected. Peroxyl radical scavenging capacity of the foxtail millet were 228.13 (Jingu28), 355.03 (Jingu34) ??mol of vitamin C equiv 100 g, respectively. CAA values of the foxtail millet varieties ranged from 1.52 to 8.97 ??mol quercetin equiv 100 g DW. The proliferation of MDA, HepG2 cancer cells were significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to Jingu28, Jingu34 extractions.Obtaining from grape pomace an enzymatic extract with anti-inflammatory properties. Grape pomace, a winemaking industry by-product, is a rich source of bioactive dietary compounds. Using proteases we have developed an enzymatic process for obtaining a water-soluble extract (GP-EE) that contains biomolecules such as peptides, carbohydrates, lipids, polyphenols in soluble form. Of especial interest is its high polyphenol content (12%), of which 77% are flavonoids, 33% are phenolic acids. The present study evaluates in vitro the potential anti-inflammatory effect of GP-EE by monitoring the expression of inflammatory molecules on N13 microglia cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). GP-EE decreases the mRNA levels of the inflammatory molecules studied. The molecules under study were as follows: inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tnf (TNF-alpha), interleukin-beta (IL-beta), the ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule-1(Iba-1), the Toll like receptor-4 (TLR-4), as well as the iNOS protein level in LPS-stimulated microglia. Our findings suggest that, as a result of its ability to regulate excessive microglial activation, GP-EE possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, acting as a chemopreventive agent, it may be of therapeutic interest in neurodegenerative diseases involving neuroinflammation. We can, therefore, propose GP-EE as a useful natural extract, one that would be beneficial to apply in the field of chemopreventive compounds.Recent trends of chalcones potentialities as antiproliferative, antiresistance agents. Chalcones are natural compounds found in plants, fruits, vegetables. This class of compounds has shown many biological activities including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antihypertensive, among others. In cancer, it has been reported that chalcones interfere in several points of the signal transduction pathways related to cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, apoptosis, the reversal of multidrug resistance. The large number of research articles, patents related to chalcones is already an indication of their importance as a lead class of compounds. This article gathers recent efforts to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of chalcones, associated with their anticancer, anti resistance potential. Fenofibrate induces G0 G1 phase arrest by modulating the PPARalpha FoxO1 p27 kip pathway in human glioblastoma cells. Fenofibrate, a fibric acid derivative, is known to possess lipid-lowering effects. Although fenofibrate-induced ppar (PPARalpha) transcriptional activity has been reported to exhibit anticancer effects, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms behind the antiproliferative effects of fenofibrate in U87MG cells (human glioma cell line) using the WST-8 Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. Furthermore, we examined genome-wide gene expression profiles, molecular networks using the DAVID online software. Fenofibrate reduced the expression of 405 genes, increased the expression of 2280 genes. DAVID analysis suggested that fenofibrate significantly affected cell cycle progression, pathways involved in cancer, including the mTOR signaling pathway, insulin signaling pathway. Results of flow cytometry analysis indicated that fenofibrate induced cell cycle G0 G1 arrest in U87MG cells. Furthermore, we identified the FoxO1-p27(kip) signaling axis to be involved in fenofibrate-induced cell cycle arrest. Our findings suggest that in addition to its known lipid-lowering effects, fenofibrate may be used as an antitumor agent in glioma therapy. Weichang'an, 5-fluorouracil suppresses colorectal cancer in a mouse model. To examine the effect of Weichang'an (WCA), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on colorectal tumor, hepatic metastasis in a mouse model. Quantitative determination of hesperidin, the effective component in WCA decoction, was performed using HPLC. In vitro cytotoxicity of WCA was determined by treating HCT-116 cells with WCA diluents or serum extracted from rats that received WCA by oral gavage for 1 wk, MTT assays. Forty-eight nude mice received cecum implantation with tumor blocks subcutaneously amplified from human colon cancer cell line HCT-116. Mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups: control (CON), WCA, 5-FU, combination (WCA 5-FU). Pathological examination of tumors consisted of tissue sectioning, hematoxylin, eosin staining. Tumor weight, size were measured,, the number of metastatic lesions was counted. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was determined by ELISA. The expression levels of tumor genesis, metastasis-related proteins beta-catenin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP 7 were measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting. Cell fractionation was used to investigate intracellular distribution of beta-catenin. Parenchymal tumors were palpable in the abdomens of nude mice 2 wk post-implantation, orthotopic tumor formation rate was 100% in all groups. 5-FU treatment alone significantly decreased tumor weight compared to the CON group (1.203??0.284 g vs 1.804??0.649 g, P<0.01). WCA treatment alone reduced the rate of metastasis (50% vs 100%, P<0.05). Combination treatment of WCA 5-FU was the most effective, reducing the tumor weight (1.140??0.464 g vs 1.804??0.649 g, P<0.01), size (1493.438??740.906 mm3 vs 2180.259??816.556 mm3, P<0.05), the rate of metastases (40% vs 100%, P<0.01),, serum CEA levels (31.263??7.421 ??g L vs 43.040??11.273 ??g L, P<0.05). Expression of beta-catenin, MMP-7 was decreased in drug-treated groups compared to controls, as detected using real-time quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, respectively. Cell fractionation assays revealed that nuclear translocation of beta-catenin was reduced by WCA, or 5-FU treatments. Combination of WCA with 5-FU significantly inhibited colon tumor growth, hepatic metastases. Decreased expression of beta-catenin, MMP-7 may be important.it is further demonstrated that p(TA) particles are as effective as cisplatin (a cancer drug) against A549 cancerous cells that both showed about 36, 34% cell viability, respectively whereas linear TA showed 66% cell viability at 37.5??gmL concentration. Above this concentration p(TA), cisplatin showed almost the same toxicity against A549 cancerous cells. Additionally, p(TA) particles are found to be much more biocompatible against L929 Fibroblast cells, about 84% cell viability in comparison to linear TA with about 53% at 75??gmL concentration. Phloretin ameliorates chemokines, ICAM-1 expression via blocking of the NF-kB pathway in the TNF-alpha-induced HaCaT human keratinocytes. Previous studies found that phloretin had anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory,, anti-tumor properties. In this study, we investigated whether phloretin could suppress the production of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM 1, chemokines through downregulation of the nuclear transcription factor kappa-B (NF-kB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in TNF-alpha-stimulated HaCaT human keratinocytes. HaCaT cells were treated with phloretin, then the cells were stimulated by TNF-alpha. Phloretin treatment decreased the production of IL-6, IL-8, CCL5, MDC,, TARC. Phloretin decreased ICAM-1 protein, mRNA expression,, also suppressed the adhesion of monocyte THP-1 cells to inflammatory HaCaT cells. Phloretin inhibited NF-kB translocation into the nucleus, also suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt, MAPK signal. In addition, phloretin increased heme oxygenase-1 production in a concentration-dependent manner. These results demonstrated that phloretin has anti-inflammatory effects to inhibit chemokines, ICAM-1 expressions through suppression of the NF-kB, MAPK pathways in human keratinocytes.Apoptosis induced by NAD depletion is inhibited by KN-93 in a CaMKII-independent manner. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a key enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of nicotinamide mononucleotide from nicotinamide (Nam) in the salvage pathway of mammalian NAD biosynthesis. Several potent NAMPT inhibitors have been identified, used to investigate the role of intracellular NAD, to develop therapeutics. NAD depletion induced by NAMPT inhibitors depolarizes mitochondrial membrane potential, causes apoptosis in a range of cell types. However, the mechanisms behind this depolarization have not been precisely elucidated. We observed that apoptosis of THP-1 cells in response to NAMPT inhibitors was reduced by the Ca calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor KN-93 via an unknown mechanism. The inactive analog of KN-93, KN-92, exhibited the same activity, but the CaMKII-inhibiting cell-permeable autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide II did not, indicating that the inhibition of THP-1 cell apoptosis was not dependent on CaMKII. In evaluating the mechanism of action, we confirmed that KN-93 did not inhibit decreases in NAD levels but did inhibit decreases in mitochondrial membrane potential, indicating that KN-93 exerts inhibition upstream of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Further, qPCR analysis of the Bcl-2 family of proteins showed that Bim is efficiently expressed following NAMPT inhibition, that KN-92 did not inhibit this expression. The L-type Ca channel blockers verapamil, nimodipine partially inhibited apoptosis, indicating that part of this effect is dependent on Ca channel inhibition, as both KN-93, KN-92 are reported to inhibit L-type Ca channels. On the other hand, KN-93, KN-92 did not markedly inhibit apoptosis induced by anti-cancer agents such as etoposide, actinomycin D, ABT-737, or TW-37, indicating that the mechanism of inhibition is specific to apoptosis induced by NAD depletion. These results demonstrate that NAD depletion induces a specific type of apoptosis that is effectively inhibited by the KN-93 series of compoundsBisphenol A stimulates the epithelial mesenchymal transition of estrogen negative breast cancer cells via FOXA1 signals. Estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer are associated with increased risks for metastasis, high rates of recurrence. Our present study revealed that nanomolar bisphenol A (BPA), a typical endocrine disrupting chemical, promoted the in vitro migration, induced mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ER-breast cancer cells. PCR array revealed that BPA can down regulate 12, up regulate 2 genes involved in regulation of signal transduction, biological pathways of breast cancer. The down regulated genes included FOXA1, which is a key determinant of endocrine response, down regulated by BPA via a time dependent manner. Silencing of FOXA1 by siRNA triggered the EMT of SkBr3 cells. While over expression of FOXA1 abolished BPA induced EMT. Further, 10(-8) M BPA significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1 2, p38-MAPK,, Akt in SkBr3 cells, while only PI3K Akt inhibitor LY294002 attenuated the BPA induced down regulation of FOXA1, E-Cadherin (E-Cad). Over expression of Akt also suppressed FOXA1 expression in SkBr3 cells. It suggested that PI3K Akt mediated, at least partially, BPA induced EMT of ER-breast cancer cells. In summary, our data provided the first evidence that BPA can promote the EMT of ER-breast cancer cells through down regulation of FOXA1. Investigating the effect of gallium curcumin, gallium diacetylcurcumin complexes on the structure, function, oxidative stability of the peroxidase enzyme, their anticancer, antibacterial activities. Curcumin has a wide spectrum of biological, pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiproliferative, antimicrobial, anticancer activities. Complexation of curcumin with metals has gained attention in recent years for improvement of its stability. In this study, the effect of gallium curcumin, gallium diacetylcurcumin on the structure, function, oxidative stability of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme were evaluated by spectroscopic techniques. In addition to the enzymatic investigation, the cytotoxic effect of the complexes was assessed on bladder, MCF-7 breast cancer, LNCaP prostate carcinoma cell lines by MTT assay. Furthermore, antibacterial activity of the complexes against S. aureus, E. coli was explored by dilution test method. The results showed that the complexes improve activity of HRP, also increase its tolerance against the oxidative condition. After addition of the complexes, affinity of HRP for hydrogen peroxide substrate decreases, while the affinity increases for phenol substrate. Circular dichroism, intrinsic, synchronous fluorescence spectra showed that the enzyme structure around the catalytic heme group becomes less compact, also the distance between the heme group, tryptophan residues increases due to binding of the complexes to HRP. On the whole, it can be concluded that the change in the enzyme structure upon binding to the gallium curcumin, gallium diacetylcurcumin complexes results in an increase in the antioxidant efficiency, activity of the peroxidise enzyme. The result of anticancer, antibacterial activities suggested that the complexes exhibit the potential for cancer treatment.Apigenin Inhibits Growth of Breast Cancer Cells: The Role of ERalpha, HER2 neu. Phytoestrogens are a group of plant-derived compounds with an estrogen-like activity. In mammalians, phytoestrogens bind to the esr1 (ER), participate in the regulation of cell growth, gene transcription. There are several reports of the cytotoxic effects of phytoestrogens in different cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to measure the phytoestrogen activity against breast cancer cells with different levels of ER expression, to elucidate the molecular pathways regulated by the leader compound. Methods used in the study include immunoblotting, transfection with a luciferase reporter vector,, a MTT test. We demonstrated the absence of a significant difference between ER , ER- breast cancer cell lines in their response to cytotoxic stimuli: treatment with high doses of phytoestrogens (apigenin, genistein, quercetin, naringenin) had the same efficiency in ER-positive, ER-negative cells. Incubation of breast cancer cells with apigenin revealed the highest cytotoxicity of this compound on the contrary, naringenin treatment resulted in a low cytotoxic activity. It was shown that high doses of apigenin (50 ??M) do not display estrogen-like activity, can suppress ER activation by 17beta-estradiol. Cultivation of HER2-positive breast cancer SKBR3 cells in the presence of apigenin resulted in a decrease in HER2 neu expression, accompanied by cleavage of an apoptosis substrate PARP. Therefore, the cytotoxic effects of phytoestrogens are not associated with the steroid receptors of breast cancer cells. Apigenin was found to be the most effective phytoestrogen that strongly inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells, including HER2-positive ones. Phloretin induces apoptosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 cells via JNK1 2, p38 MAPK pathways. Phloretin (Ph) existing in apples, pears, various vegetables is known to have antitumor activities in several cancer cell lines. However, little is known about its effect on human lung cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to see whether Ph could induce apoptosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells,, explore the possible underlying mechanism of action. We found that Ph markedly induced cell apoptosis of NSCLC cell line A549,, inhibited the migration of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The expression level of BAX, cleaved caspase-3, -9,, degraded form of PARP was increased, Bcl-2 was decreased after Ph treatment. In addition, the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK, ERK1 2, JNK1 2 was increased in a dose???dependent manner in parallel with Ph treatment. Inhibition of P38 MAPK, JNK1 2 by specific inhibitors significantly abolished the Ph-induced activation of the caspase-3, -9. In vivo tumor-suppression assay further indicated that Ph (20 mg kg) displayed a more significant inhibitory effect on A549 xenografts in tumor growth. All these findings indicate that Ph is able to inhibit NSCLC A549 cell growth by inducing apoptosis through P38 MAPK, JNK1 2 pathways,, therefore may prove to be an adjuvant to the treatment of NSCLC.Dietary Consumption of Black Raspberries or Their Anthocyanin Constituents Alters Innate Immune Cell Trafficking in Esophageal Cancer. Freeze-dried black raspberries (BRB), their component anthocyanins (AC),, a metabolite of BRB ACs, protocatechuic acid (PCA), inhibit the development of esophageal cancer in rats induced by the carcinogen, N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA). All three components reduce inflammation in the esophagus, in plasma. The present study determined the relation of changes in inflammatory markers to infiltration of innate immune cells into NMBA-treated esophagus. Rats were injected with NMBA (0.35 mg kg) for 5 weeks while on control diet. Following NMBA treatment, rats were fed diets containing 6.1% BRB powder, an AC-rich fraction of BRBs (3.8 ??mol g), or 500 ppm PCA. At weeks 15, 25,, 35, inflammatory biomarker expression in the plasma, esophagus was quantified,, infiltration of immune cells in the esophagus was examined. At all three time points, BRB, AC,, PCA similarly affected cytokine production in the esophagus, plasma of NMBA-treated rats, relative to the NMBA-only control. These included decreased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine ILbeta, increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10. Moreover, all three diets also increased the expression of IL12, a cytokine that activates both cytolytic natural killer, CD8( ) T cells. In addition, the three diets also decreased infiltration of both macrophages, neutrophils into the esophagus. Overall, our results suggest that another mechanism by which BRBs, ACs,, PCA inhibit NMBA-induced esophageal tumorigenesis is by altering cytokine expression, innate immune cell trafficking into tumor tissues.Identification of new highly selective inhibitors of the human ADP ATP carriers by molecular docking, in vitro transport assays. Mitochondrial carriers are proteins that shuttle a variety of metabolites, nucleotides, coenzymes across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mitochondrial ADP ATP carriers (AACs) specifically translocate the ATP synthesized within mitochondria to the cytosol in exchange for the cytosolic ADP, playing a key role in energy production, in promoting cell viability, regulating mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening. In Homo sapiens four genes code for AACs with different tissue distribution, expression patterns. Since AACs are dysregulated in several cancer types, the employment of known, new AAC inhibitors might be crucial for inducing mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. Albeit carboxyatractyloside (CATR), bongkrekic acid (BKA) are known to be powerful, highly selective AAC inhibitors, able to induce mitochondrial dysfunction at molecular level, poisoning at physiological level, we estimated here for the first time their affinity for the human recombinant AAC2 by in vitro transport assays. We found that the inhibition constants of CATR, BKA are 4 nM, 2.0 ??M, respectively. For finding new AAC inhibitors we also performed a docking-based virtual screening of an in-house developed chemical library, we identified about 100 ligands showing high affinity for the AAC2 binding region. By testing 13 commercially available molecules, out of the 100 predicted candidates, we found that 2 of them, namely suramin, chebulinic acid, are competitive AAC2 inhibitors with inhibition constants 0.3 ??M, 2.1 ??M, respectively. We also demonstrated that chebulinic acid, suramin are highly selective AAC2 inhibitors, since they poorly inhibit other human mitochondrial carriers (namely ORC1, APC1, AGC1).Dihydrochalcone Compounds Isolated from Crabapple Leaves Showed Anticancer Effects on Human Cancer Cell Lines. Seven dihydrochalcone compounds were isolated from the leaves of Malus crabapples, cv. Radiant,, their chemical structures were elucidated by UV, IR, ESI-MS, ??H-NMR, (13)C-NMR analyses. These compounds, which include trilobatin (A1), phloretin (A2), 3-hydroxyphloretin (A3), phloretin rutinoside (A4), phlorizin (A5), 6''-O-coumaroyl-4'-O-glucopyranosylphloretin (A6),, 3'''-methoxy-6''-O-feruloy-4'-O-glucopyranosyl-phloretin (A7), all belong to the phloretin class, its derivatives. Compounds A6, A7 are two new rare dihydrochalcone compounds. The results of a MTT cancer cell growth inhibition assay demonstrated that phloretin, these derivatives showed significant positive anticancer activities against several human cancer cell lines, including the A549 human lung cancer cell line, Bel 7402 liver cancer cell line, HepG2 human ileocecal cancer cell line,, HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. A7 had significant effects on all cancer cell lines, suggesting potential applications for phloretin, its derivatives. Adding a methoxyl group to phloretin dramatically increases phloretin's anticancer activity. Phloretin increases the anti-tumor efficacy of intratumorally delivered heat-shock protein 70? kDa (HSP70) in a murine model of melanoma. Recombinant HSP70 chaperone exerts a profound anticancer effect when administered intratumorally. This action is based on the ability of HSP70 to penetrate tumor cells, extract its endogenous homolog. To enhance the efficacy of HSP70 cycling, we employed phloretin, a flavonoid that enhances the pore-forming activity of the chaperone on artificial membranes. Phloretin increased the efficacy of HSP70 penetration in B16 mouse melanoma cells, K-562 human erythroblasts this was accompanied with increased transport of the endogenous HSP70 to the plasma membrane. Importantly, treatment with HSP70 combined with phloretin led to the elevation of cell sensitivity to cytotoxic lymphocytes by 16-18? % compared to treatment with the chaperone alone. The incubation of K-562 cells with biotinylated HSP70, phloretin increased the amount of the chaperone released from cells, suggesting that chaperone cycling could trigger a specific anti-tumor response. We studied the effect of the combination of HSP70, phloretin using B16 melanoma, a novel method of HSP70-gel application. We found that the addition of phloretin to the gel reduced tumor weight almost fivefold compared with untreated mice, while the life span of the animals extended from 25 to 39? days. The increased survival was corroborated by the activation of innate, adaptive immunity interestingly, HSP70 was more active in induction of CD8 ? cell-mediated toxicity, gammaIFN production while phloretin contributed largely to the CD56 cell response. In conclusion, the combination of HSP70 with phloretin could be a novel treatment for efficient immunotherapy of intractable cancers such as skin melanoma.Chemical composition, antioxidant, antitumor, anticancer, cytotoxic effects of Psidium guajava leaf extracts. Context Psidium guajava L. (Myrtaceae) leaves are used in traditional medicines for the treatment of cancer, inflammation, other ailments. The current study explores scientific validation for this traditional medication. Materials, methods We used ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazil (DPPH) assays to estimate antioxidant activity of P. guajava leaf extracts (methanol, hexane, chloroform). Antitumor, in vivo cytotoxic activities were determined using potato disc assay (PDA), brine shrimp lethality assay, respectively. Three human carcinoma cell lines (KBM5, SCC4, U266) were incubated with different doses of extracts, the anticancer activity was estimated by MTT assay. NF-kB suppressing activity was determined using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Chemical composition of the three extracts was identified by GC-MS. Total phenolic, flavonoid contents were measured by colorimetric assays. , discussions The order of antioxidant activity of three extracts was methanol, chloroform, hexane. The IC50 values ranged from 22.73 to 51.65 mL for KBM5 22.82 to 70.25 mL for SCC4, 20.97 to 89.55 mL for U266 cells. The hexane extract exhibited potent antitumor, cytotoxic activities. This extract also completely inhibited the TNF-alpha induced NF-kB activation in KBM5 cells. GC-MS results showed that pyrogallol, palmitic acid, vitamin E were the major components of methanol, chloroform, hexane extracts. We observed significant difference in total phenolic, flavonoid contents of different solvent extracts. The present study demonstrates that P. guajava leaf extracts play a substantial role against cancer, down-modulate inflammatory nuclear factor kB. Inhibitory effect of luteolin on the proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines induced by epidermal growth factor. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the proliferation of breast cancer cells induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in vitro. MTT assay was used to detect the inhibitory effect of luteolin on the proliferation of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells as well as the effect on the proliferation of MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. Western blotting was used to detect the effects of luteolin on the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (Erk) 1 2, signal transducers, activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) in MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. The results showed that luteolin could significantly inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells,, the inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells was more prominent. Moreover, luteolin could inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. Western blotting results showed that luteolin, AG1478 (an inhibitor of EGFR signaling) could inhibit the expression of p-EGFR, p-STAT3 in MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. Luteolin, LY294002 (an inhibitor of Akt signaling), PD98059 (an inhibitor of Erk1 2 signaling) could inhibit the expression of p-Akt, p-Erk1 2 respectively in MCF-7 cells induced by EGF. Our data suggest that luteolin may inhibit EGF-induced activities of EGFR signaling pathway in human breast cancer cell lines,, PI3K Akt, MAPK Erk1 2, STAT3 signal pathways may be the major pathways that mediate the inhibitory effect of luteolin on EGFR signaling. Overall, our results may provide a theoretical foundation for the development of luteolin as anti-tumor drug. Disubstituted naphthyl beta-D-xylopyranosides: Synthesis, GAG priming,, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibition. Xylosides are a group of compounds that can induce glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain synthesis independently of a proteoglycan core protein. We have previously shown that the xyloside 2-(6-hydroxynaphthyl)beta-D-xylopyranoside has a tumor-selective growth inhibitory effect both in vitro, in vivo,, that the effect in vitro was correlated to a reduction in histone H3 acetylation. In addition, GAG chains have previously been reported to inhibit histone acetyltransferases (HAT). To investigate if xylosides, or the corresponding xyloside-primed GAG chains, can be used as HAT inhibitors, we have synthesized a series of naphthoxylosides carrying structural motifs similar to the aromatic moieties of the known HAT inhibitors garcinol, curcumin,, studied their biological activities. Here, we show that the disubstituted naphthoxylosides induced GAG chain synthesis,, that the ones with at least one free phenolic group exhibited moderate HAT inhibition in vitro, without affecting histone H3 acetylation in cell culture.Capsaicin Inhibited Aggressive Phenotypes through Downregulation of Tumor-Associated NADH Oxidase (tNOX) by POU Domain Transcription Factor POU3F2. Capsaicin has been reported to preferentially inhibit the activity of tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX), which belongs to a family of growth-related plasma membrane hydroquinone oxidases in cancer transformed cells. The inhibitory effect of capsaicin on tNOX is associated with cell growth attenuation, apoptosis. However, no previous study has examined the transcriptional regulation of tNOX protein expression. Bioinformatic analysis has indicated that the tNOX promoter sequence harbors a binding motif for POU3F2, which is thought to play important roles in neuronal differentiation, melanocytes growth differentiation, tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that capsaicin-mediated tNOX downregulation, cell migration inhibition were through POU3F2. The protein expression levels of POU3F2, tNOX are positively correlated,, that overexpression of POU3F2 (and the corresponding upregulation of tNOX) enhanced the proliferation, migration, invasion in AGS (human gastric carcinoma) cells. In contrast, knockdown of POU3F2 downregulates tNOX,, the cancer phenotypes are affected. These findings not only shed light on the molecular mechanism of the anticancer properties of capsaicin, but also the transcription regulation of tNOX expression that may potentially explain how POU3F2 is associated with tumorigenesis. Anti-tumor activity of benzylideneacetophenone derivatives via proteasomal inhibition in prostate cancer cells. A number of some chalcone derivatives possess promising biological properties including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant,, anti-tumor activity. Although it has been shown that some derivatives of chalcone induce apoptosis in different kinds of cancer cells, the involved mechanism of action is not well defined. The purpose of this study is to investigate the primary target of a benzylideneacetophenone derivative (JC3), which is a synthetic compound derived from the chalcone family, in human cancer, using prostate cancer cells as a working model. Herein, we show that JC3 inhibits proteasomal activity as indicated by both in vitro, in cell-based assays. Especially, the JC3-dimer was more potent than monomer in the aspect of proteasome inhibition, which induced apoptosis significantly in the prostate cancer cells. Owing to the critical roles of the proteasome in the biology of human tumor progression, invasion,, metastasis, these findings give an important clue for the development of novel anti-tumor agents.Aminoglycoside-derived amphiphilic nanoparticles for molecular delivery. The development of effective drug carriers can lead to improved outcomes in a variety of disease conditions. Here, we describe the development of novel aminoglycoside-derived amphiphilic nanoparticles for drug delivery, with an eye towards ablation of cancer cells. mPEG-PAE nanoparticles were able to carry significant amounts of doxorubicin (DOX), presumably by means of hydrophobic interactions between the drug, the core. Cell-based studies indicated that mPEG-PAE nanoparticles, loaded with doxorubicin, were able to induce significant loss in viabilities of PC3 human prostate cancer, MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer,, MB49 murine bladder cancer cells empty nanoparticles resulted in negligible losses of cell viability under the conditions investigated. Taken together, our results indicate that the mPEG-PAE nanoparticle platform is attractive for drug delivery in different applications, including cancer.Inhibition of Autophagy Enhances Curcumin United light irradiation-induced Oxidative Stress, Tumor Growth Suppression in Human Melanoma Cells. Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin carcinoma, which possesses fast propagating, highly invasive characteristics. Curcumin is a natural phenol compound that has various biological activities, such as anti-proliferative, apoptosis-accelerating impacts on tumor cells. Unfortunately, the therapeutical activities of Cur are severely hindered due to its extremely low bioavailability. In this study, a cooperative therapy of low concentration Cur combined with red united blue light irradiation was performed to inspect the synergistic effects on the apoptosis, proliferation, autophagy in human melanoma A375 cell. The results showed that red united blue light irradiation efficaciously synergized with Cur to trigger oxidative stress-mediated cell death, induce apoptosis, inhibit cell proliferation. Meanwhile, Western blotting revealed that combined disposure induced the formation of autophagosomes. Conversely, inhibition of the autophagy enhanced apoptosis, obstructed cell cycle arrest, induced reversible proliferation arrest to senescence. These findings suggest that Cur combined with red united blue light irradiation could generate photochemo-preventive effects via enhancing apoptosis, triggering autophagy,, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy convert reversible arrested cells to senescence, therefore reducing the possibility that damaged cells might escape programmed death.Structure related effects of flavonoid aglycones on cell cycle progression of HepG2 cells: Metabolic activation of fisetin, quercetin by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Dietary flavonoids are abundant in the Plant Kingdom, they are extensively studied because of their manifold pharmacological activities. Recent studies highlighted that cell cycle arrest plays a key role in their antiproliferative effect in different tumor cells. However, structure-activity relationship of flavonoids is poorly characterized. In our study the influence of 18 flavonoid aglycones (as well as two metabolites) on cell cycle distribution was investigated. Since flavonoids are extensively metabolized by liver cells, HepG2 tumor cell line was applied, considering the potential metabolic activation inactivation of flavonoids. Our major observations are the followings: (1) Among the tested compounds diosmetin, fisetin, apigenin, lutelin,, quercetin provoked spectacular extent of G2 M phase cell cycle arrest. (2) Inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase enzyme by entacapone decreased the antiproliferative effects of fisetin, quercetin. (3) Geraldol, isorhamnetin (3'-O-methylated metabolites of fisetin, quercetin, respectively) demonstrated significantly higher antiproliferative effect on HepG2 cells compared to the parent compounds. Based on these results, O-methylated flavonoid metabolites or their chemically modified derivatives may be suitable candidates of tumor therapy.Curcumin inhibits H2O2-induced invasion, migration of human pancreatic cancer via suppression of the ERK NF-kB pathway. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a natural polyphenol present in turmeric, possesses a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, antitumor metastatic activities. However, the underlying mechanisms by which curcumin suppresses the metastasis of pancreatic cancer are still not fully elucidated. Our previous study demonstrated that a moderate amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is able to promote pancreatic cancer invasion. The aim of this study was to determine whether curcumin can suppress H2O2-induced tumor invasive, migratory abilities. Human pancreatic cancer BxPC-3, Panc-1 cells were exposed to H2O2 with or without curcumin or N-acetylcysteine (NAC a scavenger of free radicals). The effects of curcumin on pancreatic cancer cell proliferation was analyzed using MTT assay. The intracellular ros? (ROS) was determined using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorecein diacetate. The cellular invasive, migratory abilities were analyzed using Transwell Matrigel invasion assay, wound healing assay, respectively. The expressions of matrix metalloproteinase? (MMP 2, MMP-9 were determined using qT-PCR, western blotting at mRNA, protein level. The activation of p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase? (ERK), p-nuclear factor-kB? (NF-kB) were measured by western blotting. Our data showed that curcumin inhibited cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Curcumin, NAC were able to inhibit H2O2-induced ROS production, reduce the migration, invasion,, decrease the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 in pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the H2O2???induced elevation of p-ERK, p-NF-kB in BxPC-3, Panc-1 cells were reduced by curcumin, NAC, PD? 98059 (an ERK inhibitor). These data indicate that curcumin suppresses pancreatic cancer migration, invasion through the inhibition of the ROS ERK NF-kB signaling pathway. This study suggests that curcumin may be a potential anticancer agent for pancreatic cancer.Halogenated naphthochalcones, structurally related naphthopyrazolines with antitumor activity. Three 3-(3-halo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl 1-(2-naphthyl)prop-2-en-1-ones 1, three structurally related 2-pyrazolines 2 were prepared, assessed in vitro for anticancer activity. The chalcones 1 were antiproliferative with low double-digit micromolar IC50 values against six tumor cell lines whereas the pyrazolines 2 showed low single-digit micromolar IC50 values against this panel. The pyrazolines inhibited ATP-binding cassette efflux transporters of types P-gp, BCRP while the chalcones inhibited selectively BCRP. All test compounds induced an accumulation of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells in the G2 M phase of the cell cycle, they interfered with the microtubule, F-actin dynamics, but only the chalcones induced apoptosis in 518A2 melanoma cells aftesr24h.Acryloylphenylcarboxamides: A New Class of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2) Modulators. Chalcones are easily synthesized natural precursors of secondary plant metabolites,, their derivatives show various biological activities including inhibition of ABC transporters. Especially, their role as inhibitors of ABCG2, the most recently discovered ABC transporter involved in multidrug resistance, inspired the synthesis of new structurally diverse derivatives. Therefore, we combined the typical chalcone moiety with several acid chlorides by using an amide linker at position 2', 3', or 4' on ring???A of the chalcone. The resulting 35 compounds covered a wide spectrum of substitution patterns, which allowed development of structure-activity relationships, to find the optimal structural features for further investigations. Synthesized acryloylphenylcarboxamides were investigated for their inhibitory activity against ABCG2, their behavior toward ABCB1, ABCC1. Furthermore, for the most promising compounds, their intrinsic cytotoxicity, their ability to reverse ABCG2-mediated multidrug resistance were determined.Preclinical validation of the small molecule drug quininib as a novel therapeutic for colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths. Molecularly targeted therapies (e.g. bevacizumab) have improved survival rates but drug resistance ultimately develops, newer therapies are required. We identified quininib as a small molecule drug with anti-angiogenic activity using in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo screening models. Quininib (2- (E 2-(Quinolin-2-yl) vinyl phenol), is a small molecule drug (molecular weight 283.75???g mol), which significantly inhibited blood vessel development in zebrafish embryos (p???<???0.001). In vitro, quininib reduced endothelial tubule formation (p???<???0.001), cell migration was unaffected by quininib, cell survival was reduced by quininib (p???<???0.001). Using ex vivo human CRC explants, quininib significantly reduced the secretions of IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, ENA-78, GRO-alpha, TNF, IL-beta, MCP-1 ex vivo (all values p???<???0.01). Quininib is well tolerated in mice when administered at 50???mg kg intraperitoneally every 3 days, significantly reduced tumor growth of HT-29-luc2 CRC tumor xenografts compared to vehicle control. In addition, quininib reduced the signal from a alphavbeta3 integrin fluorescence probe in tumors 10 days after treatment initiation, indicative of angiogenic inhibition. Furthermore, quininib reduced the expression of angiogenic genes in xenografted tumors. Collectively, these findings support further development of quininib as a novel therapeutic agent for CRC.Design, synthesis, cytotoxic activity of certain novel chalcone analogous compounds. A series of chalcone analogous compounds were designed, synthesized. Replacing substituting the enone or ethylenic bridge of the parent chalcone with rigid heterocyclic moieties or substituted aromatic amines gave nineteen target compounds. Their cytotoxic activities were screened against both breast, liver cancer cells as well as breast, liver normal cells. Target compounds were also evaluated for their inhibition activity of tubulin beta polymerization. Target compound 2e, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a-4d, 5a, 5b, 6 showed broad spectrum excellent anticancer activity against both MCF-7, HepG2. Compound 4a showed the most TUBb inhibition activity.Design, synthesis, activity of novel sorafenib analogues bearing chalcone unit. Two series of sorafenib derivatives (N-methylpicolinamide-4-oxy) chalcones (5a-o, 7a-e) were synthesized, characterized by NMR, MS. All of the target compounds were evaluated for the cytotoxicity against A549, HepG2, MCF-7,, PC-3 cancer cell lines, some selected compounds were further evaluated for the activity against VEGFR-2 KDR, BRAF kinases. The results indicated that all the compounds showed moderate to good antitumor activity,, the compound 5c showed well cytotoxic activity against HepG2, MCF-7, PC-3 cell lines with IC50 values of 0.56??0.83??M, 3.88??1.03??M, 3.15??0.81??M, which were 1.03-6.14-fold more active than sorafenib (3.44??1.50??M, 3.18??1.43??M, 3.24??0.45??M), respectively. The compound 5b showed good activity on VEGFR-2 KDR kinase,, its IC50 value was 0.72??M. Structure-activity relationships (SARs), docking studies indicated that replacement of urea group of sorafenib by chalcone ketones improved the cytotoxic activity,, the results suggested that halogen 3-Br, 4-F , methoxy (substituted on C-3,4,5 or C-2,3,4 position) substitution was benefit for the activity.Molecular Mechanisms of Anti-metastatic Activity of Curcumin. Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. Although cancer occurs as a localized disease, its morbidity, mortality rates remain high due to the ability of cancer cells to break-off from the primary tumor, spread to distant organs. Currently, chemotherapy is the main treatment for cancer however, the increase in proportion of drug-resistant cancer cells, unpleasant side-effects of chemotherapy are still the major challenges in cancer therapy. Curcumin is a natural polyphenol compound, the main bioactive constituent of Indian spice turmeric, widely used in Indian, Chinese medicines. Curcumin has well-known therapeutic actions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anti-cancer properties. Curcumin induces cancer cell apoptosis through regulating various signaling pathways, arresting tumor cell cycle. Curcumin's therapeutic preventative actions on metastatic cancers have not been yet fully understood, studied. The present review explores the potential anti-metastatic mechanisms of curcumin, including inhibition of transcription factors, their signaling pathways (e.g., NF-kB, ApP-1, STAT3), inflammatory cytokines (e.g., CXCL1, CXCL2, IL-6, IL-8), multiple proteases (e.g., uPA, MMPs), multiple protein kinases (e.g., MAPKs, FAK), regulation of miRNAs (e.g., miR21, miR181b), heat shock proteins (HLJ1). In addition, possible synergistic actions of combination therapy of curcumin with current chemotherapies are discussed in this review. Novel synthetic chalcones induce apoptosis in the A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells harboring a KRAS mutation. A series of novel chalcones were synthesized by the Claisen-Schmidt condensation reaction of tetralones, 5- 6-indolecarboxaldehydes. Treatment of human lung cancer cell line harboring KRAS mutation (A549) with the chalcones induced dose-dependent apoptosis. Cell cycle analyses, Western blotting suggested the critical role of the chalcones in interrupting G2 M transition of cell cycle. SAR study demonstrated that substituent on the indole N atom significantly affects the anticancer activity of the chalcones, with methyl, ethyl providing the more active compounds (EC50: 110-200nM), Compound 1g was found to be >4-fold more active in the A549 cells (EC50: 110nM) than in prostate (PC3) or pancreatic cancer (CLR2119, PAN02) cells. Furthermore, compound 1l selectively induced apoptosis of lung cancer cells A549 (EC50: 0.55??M) but did not show measurable toxicity in the normal lung bronchial epithelial cells (hBEC) at doses as high as 10??M, indicating specificity towards cancer cells. Apoptotic effect of chalcone derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene in human breast cancer cells. A variety of chalcones have demonstrated cytotoxic activity toward several cancer cell lines. This study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity of four chalcones derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene in human breast cancer cell lines. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with synthesized chalcones, the cytotoxicity was evaluated by tetrazolium dye (MTT), live dead,, DAPI assays. Chalcones significantly decreased MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 cells viability in vitro in a dose dependent manner. After 48h treatment, the IC50 values ranging from 5.52 to 34.23??M. Chalcone 3c displayed the highest cytotoxic activity from all the tested compounds. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were confirmed in the live dead assay. In addition, DAPI staining revealed that these compounds induce death by apoptosis. The data speculate that chalcone derivatives of 2-acetylthiophene may represent a source of therapeutic agents for human breast cancer. Capsaicin synergizes with camptothecin to induce increased apoptosis in human small cell lung cancers via the calpain pathway. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by excellent initial response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy with a majority of the patients showing tumor shrinkage, even remission. However, the challenge with SCLC therapy is that patients inevitably relapse, subsequently do not respond to the first line treatment. Recent clinical studies have investigated the possibility of camptothecin-based combination therapy as first line treatment for SCLC patients. Conventionally, camptothecin is used for recurrent SCLC, has poor survival outcomes. Therefore, drugs which can improve the therapeutic index of camptothecin should be valuable for SCLC therapy. Extensive evidence shows that nutritional compounds like capsaicin (the spicy compound of chili peppers) can improve the anti-cancer activity of chemotherapeutic drugs in both cell lines, animal models. Statistical analysis shows that capsaicin synergizes with camptothecin to enhance apoptosis of human SCLC cells. The synergistic activity of camptothecin, capsaicin is observed in both classical, variant SCLC cell lines and, in vivo, in human SCLC tumors xenotransplanted on chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) models. The synergistic activity of capsaicin, camptothecin are mediated by elevation of intracellular calcium, the calpain pathway. Our data foster hope for novel nutrition based combination therapies in SCLC.Design, Synthesis,, Biological Evaluation of Coupled Bioactive Scaffolds as Potential Anticancer Agents for Dual Targeting of Dihydrofolate Reductase, Thioredoxin Reductase. The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzymes are involved in the process of tumor cell growth, survival. The 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine scaffold is well-established as a useful scaffold for DHFR inhibition, while chalcones have been reported to be inhibitors of TrxR. In this study, 15 novel compounds designed by the structural combination of the 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine, chalcone scaffolds via a diether linker were successfully synthesized, characterized. All of the compounds demonstrated dual inhibition against DHFR, TrxR when they were assessed by in vitro enzyme assays. The compounds also exhibited antiproliferative activity against the MCF-7, HCT116 cells. The more potent analogs 14, 15 were found to inhibit cellular DHFR, TrxR activities in HCT116 cells. Therefore, this study provided compelling evidence that 14, 15 could exert their anticancer property via multitarget inhibition at the cellular level.Ascofuranone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response via NF-kappaB, AP-1, p-ERK, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-beta in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The natural fungal compound ascofuranone (5-chloro-3- (2E,6E 7- (2S 5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-tetrahydrofuran-2-yl -3-methyl-octa-2,6-dienyl -2,4-dihydroxy-6-methyl-benzaldehyde, MW 420.93) (AF) isolated from Ascochyta viciae has been known to promote cell cycle arrest, inhibit invasion of tumor cells. We have previously studied a structurally similar compound ascochlorin (ASC MW 404.93) with regard to its anti-inflammatory activity in LPS- stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. In order to examine the relationship between the anti-inflammatory activities, the molecular differences between AF, ASC, the activity of AF is herein studied, because ASC has a unique trimethyl oxocyclohexyl structure, while AF has a unique dimethyl-oxo-tetrahydrofuran structure. AF dose-dependently inhibited the production of NO, iNOS, the COX-2 mRNA, protein levels in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, AF suppressed mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-6,, IL-beta, as assessed by RT-PCR. AF (30-50 ??g ml) treatment clearly inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kB, AP-1 (p-c-Jun) from the cytosolic space. Phosphorylation of IkB, which functions to maintain the activity of NF-kB, was decreased by AF treatment. Moreover, AF suppressed the binding of NF-kB (p65). Inhibition of IkBa phosphorylation, degradation inhibits nuclear translocation of p65. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analysis also revealed that translocation of NF-kB, AP-1 (p-c-Jun) was decreased upon AF treatment. AF specifically decreased the expression level of p-ERK, but not the expression level of p-p38 or p-JNK. Given these results, we suggest that AF suppresses the inflammatory response by targeting p-ERK. This indicates that AF is a negative regulator of LPS-stimulated nuclear translocation of NF-kB, AP-1 (p-c-Jun) in RAW 264.7 macrophages,, specifically it targets p-ERK. Therefore, AF, ASC exert their effects in different ways, most probably because their structural differences allow for specific recognition, inhibition of their target MAPKs. Our results further suggest that AF could be a natural bioactive compound useful for treating inflammation-mediated pathological diseases.Synthesis, biological evaluation of novel pyrazolic chalcone derivatives as novel hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutics. Despite having the second highest mortality associated with cancer, currently Sorafenib is the only FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agent available for liver cancer patients which can only improve survival for few months. In this study, various pyrazolic chalcone analogous compounds were synthesized, evaluated as potential chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Modifying the central pyrazole ring at the C(3 position with different heteroaryl rings, substituting the C(4 position of pyrazole with differently substituted chalcone moiety produced fouthy two variant compounds. For all these compounds, cytotoxicity was evaluated using sulforhodamine B assay, real time cell growth tracking, respectively. Based on 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, compounds 39, 42, 49,, 52 were shown to exhibit potent cytotoxic activity against all the cancer cell lines tested,, had better cytotoxic activities than the well-known chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU. Therefore, these compounds were chosen to be further evaluated in a panel of HCC cell lines. Flow cytometric analysis of HCC cells treated with compounds 39, 42, 49,, 52 demonstrated that these compounds caused cell cycle arrest at G2 M phase followed by the apoptotic cell death, impaired cell growth as shown by real-time cell growth surveillance. Consistent with these results, western blotting of HCC cells treated with the compounds resulted in molecular changes for cell cycle proteins, where p21 levels were increased independent of p53, the levels of the key initiators of mitosis Cyclin B1, CDK1 were shown to decrease upon treatment. In conclusion, chalcone derivatives 42, 52 show potent bioactivities by modulating the expression of cell-cycle related proteins, resulting in cell-cycle arrest in the HCC cell lines tested here, indicating that the compounds can be considered as preclinical candidates.Pentabromophenol suppresses TGF-beta signaling by accelerating degradation of type II TGF-beta receptors via caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Pentabromophenol (PBP), a brominated flame retardant (BFR), is widely used in various consumer products. BFRs exert adverse health effects such as neurotoxic, endocrine-disrupting effects. In this study, we found that PBP suppressed TGF-beta response by accelerating the turnover rate of TGF-beta receptors. PBP suppressed TGF-beta-mediated cell migration, PAI-1 promoter-driven reporter gene activation,, Smad2 3 phosphorylation in various cell types. Furthermore, PBP abolished TGF-beta-mediated repression of E-cadherin expression, in addition to the induction of vimentin expression, N-cadherin, fibronectin upregulation, thus blocking TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in A549, NMuMG cells. However, this inhibition was not observed with other congeners such as tribromophenol, triiodophenol. TGF-beta superfamily members play key roles in regulating various biological processes including cell proliferation, migration as well as cancer development, progression. The results of this in vitro study provide a basis for studies on the detailed relationship between PBP, modulation of TGF-beta signalling. Because PBP is similar to other BFRs such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), additional laboratory, mechanistic studies should be performed to examine BFRs as potential risk factors for tumorigenesis, other TGF-beta-related diseases.TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 expressions, responsible for disparity in action of curcumin against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Cisplatin is a regularly employed effective chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of many types of cancer. The main drawback of cisplatin treatment is kidney toxicity which affects 25-35% of treated patients. Many mechanisms are believed to be involved in this kidney damage, but inflammation plays a significant role in this event. Curcumin is a polyphenol, has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects. The purpose of this study was to determine the protective effects of curcumin on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Female rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control, curcumin, cisplatin, curcumin plus cisplatin (pre-treatment group), cisplatin plus curcumin (post-treatment group). Rats were given cisplatin (7.5? mg kg body weight) with or without curcumin treatment (120? mg kg body weight). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, albumin, tnf (TNF alpha, interleukin (IL beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 expressions, histological changes were determined on the 5th day after cisplatin injection. Acute kidney damage was evident by increased BUN, creatinine levels. In addition, cisplatin showed a marked pro-inflammatory response as revealed by a significant increase in the tissue levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, decrease in the IL-10 level. Pre-treatment of curcumin reduced cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity which was clearly evident from the reduced BUN, creatinine, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 levels, increased albumin, IL-10 levels. Additionally, these findings were also supported by histopathology of the kidneys. In contrast, post-treatment of curcumin failed to cut down the expression of inflammatory markers substantially, also neglected to increase the expression of IL-10. The disparity in the action of curcumin after pre-, post-treatment with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity was due to the inability of post-treatment to reduce TNF-alpha IL-6, besides to show a concurrent rise in IL-10 expression in renal tissues.Induction of G2M Arrest by Flavokawain A, a Kava Chalcone, Increases the Responsiveness of HER2-Overexpressing Breast Cancer Cells to Herceptin. HER2 neu positive breast tumors predict a high mortality, comprise 25%-30% of breast cancer. We have shown that Flavokawain A (FKA) preferentially reduces the viabilities of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines (i.e., SKBR3, MCF7 HER2) versus those with less HER2 expression (i.e., MCF7, MDA-MB-468). FKA at cytotoxic concentrations to breast cancer cell lines also has a minimal effect on the growth of non-malignant breast epithelial MCF10A cells. FKA induces G2M arrest in cell cycle progression of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines through inhibition of Cdc2, Cdc25C phosphorylation, downregulation of expression of Myt1, Wee1 leading to increased Cdc2 kinase activities. In addition, FKA induces apoptosis in SKBR3 cells by increasing the protein expression of Bim, BAX, decreasing expression of Bcl???, BclX L, XIAP,, survivin. FKA also downregulates the protein expression of HER-2, inhibits AKT phosphorylation. Herceptin plus FKA treatment leads to an enhanced growth inhibitory effect on HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines through downregulation of Myt1, Wee1, Skp2, survivin,, XIAP. Our results suggest FKA as a promising, novel apoptosis inducer, G2 blocking agent that, in combination with Herceptin, enhances for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.Combination of ABT-737, resveratrol enhances DNA damage, apoptosis in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cells. ABT-737 belongs to a new class of anticancer agents named BH3 mimetics. ABT-737 competitively binds to surface hydrophobic grooves of anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family, counteracting their protective effect. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, or induce apoptosis in a number of different types of cancer cells. The present study was designed to analyze the combined effects of ABT-737, resveratrol on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of these agents against MOLT-4 leukemia cells was determined using the Coulter electrical impedance method, comet assay,, flow cytometry, light microscopy, western blot techniques. The results are the first data showing that ABT-737 combined with resveratrol markedly decreased the cell viability, increased DNA damage, caused the cell cycle perturbation,, synergistically enhanced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells, when compared to the data obtained after application of the single agent. Moreover, the simultaneous treatment of leukemia cells with ABT-737, resveratrol resulted in a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase of p53 protein level, up-regulation of the Bax Bcl-2 ratio. The obtained data indicate that the combination of ABT-737, resveratrol is a promising approach for acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment that should be further explored. Novel 3',5'-diprenylated chalcones inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells in? vitro by inducing cell apoptosis, arresting cell cycle phase. A double Claisen rearrangements synthetic strategy was established for the total synthesis of 4,4'-dimethyl medicagenin (compound 6c). A series of its analogs also were prepared, including two novel 3',5'-diprenylated chalcones, in which ring B was replaced by azaheterocycle. The structures of the twenty-two newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ESI-MS. In? vitro, the cytotoxicity of the target compounds was evaluated using cancer cells. Noticeably, compound 10 exhibited broad-spectrum cytotoxicity on PC3 prostate cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (MDA), HEL, K562 erythroleukemia cells with IC50 values of 2.92, 3.14, 1.85, 2.64? ??M, respectively. Further studies indicated that compound 10 induced apoptosis, arrested the cell cycle phase of the above mentioned four cancer cell lines. By contrast, compound 6g selectively displayed potent inhibitory activity against the proliferation of HEL cells with an IC50 value of 4.35? ??M. Compound 6g slightly induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle phase of HEL cells. Preliminary structure-activity relationship studies indicated that, in all cancer cell lines evaluated, the 3-pyridinyl group was essential for cytotoxicity.Ginkgolic acids inhibit migration in breast cancer cells by inhibition of NEMO sumoylation, NF-kB activity. Ginkgolic acids (GA), a group of alkyl phenols found in crude extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves, are known to have anticancer activity, but their mode of action is not well understood. Our aim in this study was to investigate the anti-migratory activity of seven GA against breast cancer cells, to determine the molecular mechanism behind this activity. All seven GA, their mixture inhibited wound healing in MCF-7, MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. None of the compounds nor the mixture showed cytotoxicity towards the two cell lines, if tested by the resazurin assay. C13:0 inhibited NF-kB activity in the HEK Blue Null 1 reporter cell line. Furthermore, C13:0 inhibited degradation of nuclear factor of k-light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor alpha (IkBalpha). Sumoylation assay revealed that GA inhibited sumoylation of NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO). Molecular docking on SUMO-activating enzyme E1 showed that the seven GA bound to the active adenylation site with high calculated affinities ranging from -10.28 to -12.27 kcal mol. Quantitative RT-PCR using C15:0, C13:0, the mixture showed a significant down-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). We conclude that GA revealed considerable anti-migratory activity at non-cytotoxic concentrations, indicating anti-metastatic activity with low toxicity. This effect can be explained by the inhibition of NEMO sumoylation leading to inhibition of IkBalpha degradation, consequently a reduction of NF-kB activity, leading to the down-regulation of metastasis related genes including uPA, PAI-1, CXCR4,, MMP-9.Bisphenol A activates EGFR, ERK promoting proliferation, tumor spheroid formation, resistance to EGFR pathway inhibition in esr1-negative inflammatory breast cancer cells. Emerging evidence from epidemiological studies suggests a link between environmental chemical exposure, progression of aggressive breast cancer subtypes. Of all clinically distinct types of breast cancers, the most lethal phenotypic variant is inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR HER2) along with esr1 (ER) negativity is common in IBC tumor cells, which instead of a solid mass present as rapidly proliferating diffuse tumor cell clusters. Our previous studies have demonstrated a role of an adaptive response of increased antioxidants in acquired resistance to EGFR-targeting drugs in IBC. Environmental chemicals are known to induce oxidative stress resulting in perturbations in signal transduction pathways. It is therefore of interest to identify chemicals that can potentiate EGFR mitogenic effects in IBC. Herein, we assessed in ER-negative IBC cells a subset of chemicals from the EPA ToxCast set for their effect on EGFR activation, in multiple cancer phenotypic assays. We demonstrated that endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA), 2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl 1,1,1-trichloroethane can increase EGFR ERK signaling. BPA also caused a corresponding increase in expression of SOD1, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, key markers of antioxidant, anti-apoptotic processes. BPA potentiated clonogenic growth, tumor spheroid formation in vitro, reflecting IBC-specific pathological characteristics. Furthermore, we identified that BPA was able to attenuate the inhibitory effect of an EGFR targeted drug in a longer-term anchorage-independent growth assay. These findings provide a potential mechanistic basis for environmental chemicals such as BPA in potentiating a hyperproliferative, death-resistant phenotype in cancer cells by activating mitogenic pathways to which the tumor cells are addicted for survival. The protective effect of propofol against TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis was mediated via inhibiting iNOS NO production, maintaining intracellular Ca2 homeostasis in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. Inflammation cytokine tnf (TNF-alpha) induces apoptosis in neuronal cells. We hypothesized that propofol may attenuate TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells, aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Mouse hippocampal HT22 cells were pretreated with propofol,, then stimulated with TNF-alpha. Cell viability was measured by cell counting kit 8 (CCK8). Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry analysis. The effect of propofol on TNF-alpha-modulated nitric oxide production was measured by a nitrate reductase assay kit, intracellular calcium release, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization were measured by flow cytometry analysis,, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), C EBP homologous protein (CHOP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family, caspases were detected by Western blot. Compared with control, TNF-alpha concentration-, time-dependently increased HT22 cell apoptosis, which was attenuated by 25??mol l propofol. TNF-alpha (40ng ml, 24h) induced the overexpression of iNOS, the release of nitric oxide, caused the accumulation of intracellular Ca2 , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,, therefore leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, these effects were alleviated by 25??mol l propofol. We demonstrated that propofol could attenuate TNF-alpha-induced HT22 apoptosis. More importantly, we indicated that the underlying mechanism may involve iNOS NO, Ca2 , mitochondrial dysfunction. Identification of a novel chalcone derivative that inhibits Notch signaling in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Notch signaling is considered a rational target in the therapy of several cancers, particularly those harbouring Notch gain of function mutations, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We have designed, synthetized the chalcone-derivative 8 possessing Notch inhibitory activity at low micro molar concentration in T-ALL cell lines. Structure-activity relationships were afforded for the chalcone scaffold. Short term treatments with compound 8 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of Notch signaling activity, halted cell cycle progression, induced apoptosis, thus affecting leukemia cell growth. Taken together, our data indicate that 8 is a novel Notch inhibitor, against Notch-dependent cancers.A Benzylideneacetophenone Derivative Induces Apoptosis of Radiation-Resistant Human Breast Cancer Cells via Oxidative Stress. Benzylideneacetophenone derivative (1E 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) hept-1-en-3-one (JC3) elicited cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells-radiation resistant cells (MDA-MB 231-RR), in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 6 ??M JC3. JC3-mediated apoptosis was confirmed by increase in sub-G1 cell population. JC3 disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential,, reduced expression of anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma-2 protein, whereas it increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein, leading to the cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In addition, JC3 activated mitogen-activated protein kinases,, specific inhibitors of these kinases abrogated the JC3-induced increase in apoptotic bodies. JC3 increased the level of intracellular ros, enhanced oxidative macromolecular damage via lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation,, DNA strand breakage. Considering these findings, JC3 is an effective therapy against radiation-resistant human breast cancer cells.Cytotoxic effect of a novel naphthylchalcone against multiple cancer cells focusing on hematologic malignancies. Chalcones are natural compounds described in the literature by its several properties including cytotoxic activity against several tumor types. Considering that the search for new chemotherapeutic agents is still necessary, the aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic mechanisms involved in cell death induced by a synthetic chalcone (A23) on different tumor cells. Chalcone A23 reduced the cell viability of twelve tumor cell lines in a concentration, time dependent manner, it was more cytotoxic against acute leukemia cells. Interestingly, the compound was non cytotoxic to normal cells, non-hemolytic to normal red blood cells. Chalcone A23 decreased the expression of cell proliferation marker KI-67, blocked the G2 M phase in both K562, Jurkat cell lines. Cells treated with A23 showed morphological features suggestive of apoptosis, the latter pattern in agarose gel, the externalization of phosphatidylserine, caspase-3, PARP cleavage. Chalcone A23 significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, survivin, increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, confirming the involvement of the intrinsic pathway. The increased mitochondrial permeability resulted in the release of AIF, cytochrome c, endonuclease G from the mitochondria to the cytosol. In addition, chalcone A23 increased the expression of FasR, induced Bid cleavage, showing the involvement of the extrinsic pathway. Finally, chalcone A23 seems to have a synergic effect with the chemotherapy drugs cytarabine, vincristine. These results suggest that A23 is an interesting compound with strong, selective anti-tumor activity. Anticancer activity of hydroxy-, sulfonamide-azobenzene platinum(II) complexes in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. The anticancer activities of these complexes were evaluated in wild-type (A2780), cisplatin-resistant (A2780CP70) ovarian cancer cells. All three complexes exhibited IC50 values below 10??M, displayed similar activity in both A2780, A2780CP70 cell lines, indicating that they are not cross-resistant with cisplatin.Synthesis, structures, nuclease activity, cytotoxicity, DFT, molecular docking studies of two nitrato bridged homodinuclear (Cu-Cu, Zn-Zn) complexes containing 2,2'-bipyridine, a chalcone derivative. The co-ligand L binds the metal ions through its O,O' atoms in anti-syn mode. The metal centers in complexes 1, 2 are separated via bridging nitrato group at a distance of 6.073??, 5.635?? respectively. Their structures, absorption spectra are supported by the computational studies using density functional theory (DFT), TD-DFT. Both complexes exhibit nuclease activity, cleave supercoiled (form I) DNA. The complex 1 preferentially binds major groove of DNA, follows an oxidative pathway whereas complex 2 binds with minor groove of DNA via hydrolytic pathway. Both complexes inhibit topoisomerase I relaxation activity with IC50 values of 7, 35??M. Molecular docking studies support the groove binding, topoisomerase I binding of the complexes. The complex 1 showed a significant cytotoxicity against HeLa cell lines (a cervical cancer cell lines) in vitro with IC50 value calculated as 2.9??0.021??M as compared to 28.2??0. 044???? for complex 2. Complex 2 induces the cell apoptosis at a later-stage as compared to complex 1. The cell apoptosis, topoisomerase inhibition by complexes enable them to be potential candidates as future anticancer drugs. Sechium edule (Jacq.) Swartz, a New Cultivar with Antiproliferative Potential in a Human Cervical Cancer HeLa Cell Line. The Sechium edule Perla Negra cultivar is a recently-obtained biological material whose progenitors are S. edule var. nigrum minor, S. edule var. amarus silvestrys, the latter of which has been reported to have antiproliferative activity against the HeLa P-388, L-929 cancer cell lines. The present study aimed to determine if the methanolic extract of the fruit of the Perla Negra cultivar had the same biological activity. The methanolic extract was phytochemically characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC), column chromatography (CC), identifying the terpenes, flavonoids. The compounds identified via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were Cucurbitacins B, D, E,, I for the terpene fractions,, Rutin, Phlorizidin, Myricetin, Quercetin, Naringenin, Phloretin, Apigenin,, Galangin for the flavonoid fractions). Biological activity was evaluated with different concentrations of the methanolic extract in the HeLa cell line, normal lymphocytes. The methanolic extract inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells (IC50 1.85 ??g??mL-1), but the lymphocytes were affected by the extract (IC50 30.04 ??g??mL-1). Some fractions,, the pool of all of them, showed inhibition higher than 80% at a concentration of 2.11 ??g??mL-1. Therefore, the biological effect shown by the methanolic extract of the Perla Negra has some specificity in inhibiting tumor cells, not normal cells an unusual feature among molecules investigated as potential biomedical agents.Centella asiatica modulates cancer cachexia associated inflammatory cytokines, cell death in leukaemic THP-1 cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's). Cancer cachexia is associated with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Centella asiatica (C. asiatica) possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor potential. We investigated the modulation of antioxidants, cytokines, cell death by C. asiatica ethanolic leaf extract (CLE) in leukaemic THP-1 cells, normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's). Cytotoxcity of CLE was determined at 24, 72? h (h). Oxidant scavenging activity of CLE was evaluated using the 2, 2-diphenyl-1 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Glutathione (GSH) levels, caspase (-8, -9, -3 7) activities, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels (Luminometry) were then assayed. The levels of tnf (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL 6, IL-beta, IL-10 were also assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. CLE decreased PBMC viability between 33.25-74.55% (24? h: 0.2-0.8? mg ml CLE, 72? h: 0.4-0.8? mg ml CLE), THP-1 viability by 28.404% (72? h: 0.8? mg ml CLE) (p? <? 0.0001). Oxidant scavenging activity was increased by CLE (0.05-0.8? mg ml) (p? <? 0.0001). PBMC TNF-alpha, IL-10 levels were decreased by CLE (0.05-0.8? mg ml) (p? <? 0.0001). However, PBMC IL-6, IL-beta concentrations were increased at 0.05-0.2? mg ml CLE but decreased at 0.4? mg ml CLE (p? <? 0.0001). In THP-1 cells, CLE (0.2-0.8? mg ml) decreased IL-beta, IL-6 whereas increased IL-10 levels (p? <? 0.0001). In both cell lines, CLE (0.05-0.2? mg ml, 24, 72? h) increased GSH concentrations (p? <? 0.0001). At 24? h, caspase (-9, -3 7) activities was increased by CLE (0.05-0.8? mg ml) in PBMC's whereas decreased by CLE (0.2-0.4? mg ml) in THP-1 cells (p? <? 0.0001). At 72? h, CLE (0.05-0.8? mg ml) decreased caspase (-9, -3 7) activities, ATP levels in both cell lines (p? <? 0.0001). In PBMC's, THP-1 cells, CLE proved to effectively modulate antioxidant activity, inflammatory cytokines, cell death. In THP-1 cells, CLE decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels whereas it increased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels which may alleviate cancer cachexia.A comparative assessment of antiproliferative properties of resveratrol, ethanol leaf extract of Anogeissus leiocarpus (DC) Guill, Perr against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells. Epidemiological, experimental evidences have shown cancer as a leading cause of death worldwide. Although the folklore use of plants as a reliable source of health-restoring principles is well-documented, the search for more of such plants that are active against diseases, such as cancer, continues. We report here a laboratory-based evidence of the relevance of an ethanol leaf extract of Anogeissus leiocarpus (A2L) in comparison with resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, in cancer therapy. The quantitative assessment of flavonoid, phenolic contents involved quercetin, gallic acid as standards, respectively were determined using spectrophotometry. Cytotoxicity was determined fluorometrically using propidium-iodide-staining method. Antioxidant status, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, caspase activities, mitochondrial integrity were assessed using fluorometry luminometry. The antioxidant assay demonstrated that A2L possesses a strong antioxidant capacity as compared with the reference compounds, ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene. This is further buttressed by the significantly high level of phenolics obtained in the quantitative assessment of the extract. A 72-h post-treatment examination indicated that both A2L, resveratrol modulate the proliferation of HepG2 liver carcinoma cells in a time-, concentration-dependent manner. Determination of the total nuclei area, propidium-iodide negative, positive nuclei areas all further buttress the modulation of cell proliferation by A2L, resveratrol with the indication that the observed cell death is due to apoptosis, necrosis at lower, higher concentrations of treatments respectively. At lower concentrations (0.39-3.13? ??g mL), resveratrol possesses higher tendencies to activate caspases 3, 7. Assessment of 24-h post-treatment mitochondrial function shows that resveratrol is not mitotoxic as compared with A2L which exhibits mitotoxicity at its highest concentration. Taken together, findings from this study showed that A2L possesses strong antiproliferative activity, its prospect in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma deserves further investigation.Induction of Apoptosis, Cell Cycle Arrest by Flavokawain C on HT-29 Human Colon Adenocarcinoma via Enhancement of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation, Upregulation of p21, p27,, GADD153,, Inactivation of Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins. Chalcones have been shown to exhibit anti-cancer properties by targeting multiple molecular pathways. It was, therefore, of interest to investigate flavokawain C (FKC), a naturally occurring chalcone, which can be isolated from Kava (Piper methysticum Forst) root extract. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of FKC on the growth of HT-29 cells, its underlying mechanism of action. Cell viability of HT-29 cells was assessed by Sulforhodamine B assay after FKC treatment. Induction of apoptosis was examined by established morphological, biochemical assays. ROS generation was determined by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence staining,, superoxide dismutase activity was measured using the spectrophotometric method. Western blotting was used to examine the changes in the protein levels. FKC markedly decreased the cell viability of HT-29 cells, the cells showed dramatic changes in cellular, nuclear morphologies with typical apoptotic features. The induction of apoptosis correlated well with the externalization of phosphatidylserine, DNA fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspases,, PARP cleavage. This was associated with an increase in ros, a decrease in SOD activity. The protein levels of XIAP, c-IAP1,, c-IAP2 were downregulated, whereas the GADD153 was upregulated after FKC treatment. FKC induced cell cycle arrest at the G1, G2 M phases via upregulation of p21, p27 in a p53-independent manner. Our results provide evidence that FKC has the potential to be developed into chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of colon adenocarcinoma. Flavokawain C inhibited the growth of HT-29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells. Flavokawain C induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells, associated with an increase in ros, a decrease in SOD activity. Flavokawain C induced cell cycle arrest at the G1, G2 M phases via upregulation of p21, p27 in HT-29 cellsHT-29 cells treated with flavokawain C caused downregulation of XIAP, c-IAP1,, c-IAP2,, upregulation of GADD153.Novel quinolone chalcones targeting colchicine-binding pocket kill multidrug-resistant cancer cells by inhibiting tubulin activity, MRP1 function. Agents targeting colchicine-binding pocket usually show a minimal drug-resistance issue, albeit often associated with high toxicity. Chalcone-based compounds, which may bind to colchicine-binding site, are found in many edible fruits, suggesting that they can be effective drugs with less toxicity. Therefore, we synthesized, examined 24 quinolone chalcone compounds, from which we identified ((E 3-(3-(2-Methoxyphenyl 3-oxoprop-1-enyl) quinolin-2(1H one) (CTR-17), ((E 6-Methoxy-3-(3-(2-methoxyphenyl 3-oxoprop-1-enyl) quinolin-2(1H one) (CTR-20) as promising leads. In particular, CTR-20 was effective against 65 different cancer cell lines originated from 12 different tissues, largely in a cancer cell-specific manner. We found that both CTR-17, CTR-20 reversibly bind to the colchicine-binding pocket on beta-tubulin. Interestingly however, both the CTRs were highly effective against multidrug-resistant cancer cells while colchicine, paclitaxel, vinblastine were not. Our study with CTR-20 showed that it overcomes multidrug-resistance through its ability to impede MRP1 function while maintaining strong inhibition against microtubule activity. Data from mice engrafted with the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells showed that both CTR-17, CTR-20 possess strong anticancer activity, alone or in combination with paclitaxel, without causing any notable side effects. Together, our data demonstrates that both the CTRs can be effective, safe drugs against many different cancers, especially against multidrug-resistant tumors.Anticarcinogenic activity of Muntingia calabura leaves methanol extract against the azoxymethane-induced colon cancer in rats involved modulation of the colonic antioxidant system partly by flavonoids. Leaves of Muntingia calabura (Elaeocarpaceae) are widely used in traditional medical practice scientific findings show various pharmacological activities. However, its anticancer effect has not been investigated thoroughly yet. The objective of this study is to study the chemoprevention effects of MEMCL against azoxymethane (AOM induced colon cancer, to examine the involvement of endogenous antioxidants Materials, methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into five groups (n???=???7), were injected intraperitoneally once weekly for 2???weeks with 15???mg kg AOM, except for the normal group (received saline). The animals were then administered orally for 8???weeks with 8% Tween-80 (vehicle normal group), 8% Tween-80 (vehicle cancer group) or, 50, 250 or 500???mg kg MEMC. After treatments, colon samples were collected from each rat for the histopathological analysis, quantification of aberrant crypt foci formed, determination of colon antioxidant levels. MEMC was also subjected to HPLC analysis. The extract exerted significant (p???<???0.05): anti-carcinogenesis activity, indicated by a decrease in the total aberrant crypt formation antioxidant activity by increasing the colon tissue antioxidant markers i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) , reducing the oxidant marker (i.e., malonaldehyde (MDA) levels in comparison with the cancer group. HPLC analysis demonstrated the presence of rutin. Muntingia calabura leaves exert anticancer effect against AOM-induced colon cancer possibly via the action of flavonoids on the colon tissue antioxidant activity.The Study of Apoptosis-inducing Effects of Three Pre-apoptotic Factors by Gallic Acid, Using Simulation Analysis, the Comet Assay Technique on the Prostatic Cancer Cell Line PC3. In this study, we demonstrated the effects of the Gallic Acid (GA) molecule on the prostate cancer cells line PC3 using the comet assay (Alkaline electrophoresis) technique, its effects on some important apoptotic factors including BAD (Bcl-2-Associated Death promoter), BAK (Bcl-2 homologous Antagonist Killer),, BIM (Bcl-2-like protein 11) via simulation analysis by using the Auto Dock, Gromacs software. Following the MTT assay on the PC3 cells,, determining IC50, we used three concentrations of GA to around IC50 to treat PC3 cells. 100 comet pictures were obtained by alkaline electrophoresis, have been analysed with the CASP version 1.2.2 software all the results were thereafter analysed by the SPSS version 21 statistical software. The IC50 value for GA was determined to be 35 ??M. The ratio of tail to head in alkaline electrophoresis for the three concentrations below the IC50 of GA in 25, 30,, 35 ??M were measured as 24.7 (2.7), 44.5 (1.8),, 57.3 (1.3) percent, respectively. The results of the preapoptotic factors (BAD, BAK,, BIM) in the performed simulation in the absence, presence of GA showed that the GA protein causes the structural instability in the BAD protein,, the effect of GA can be explained by the creation of hydrogen bonds with proteins. GA is a polyphenol compound in plants that can suppress cell growth, induce apoptosis in PC3 cells in prostate cancer in the range of IC50 concentrations. The apoptotic properties of GA induce pre-apoptotic factors.The effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the incident , recurrent risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis. Recent studies have showed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could reduce the risk of several types of cancer. However, epidemiological evidence of the association between NSAIDs intake , the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains controversial. To assess the preventive benefit of NSAIDs in HCC, we simultaneously searched the databases of PubMed, EmBase, Web of Science, , Scopus , screened eligible publications. A total of twelve articles (published from 2000 to 2017) from five countries were identified by retrieval. We observed a significantly lower risk of HCC incidence among users of NSAIDs than among those who did not use NSAIDs (pooled hazard ratio HR value =0.81, 95% confidence interval CI : 0.69-0.94). No evidence of publication bias was observed (Begg's test, P=0.755 Egger's test, P=0.564). However, when stratified according to the categories of NSAIDs, users of non-aspirin NSAIDs (HR =0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.94), but not aspirin (HR =0.77, 95% CI: 0.58-1.02), showed a statistically significant reduced HCC incidence. We also found that NSAIDs use significantly reduced the recurrent risk of HCC, with a HR value of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75-0.84), whereas there was no statistically significant association between NSAIDs use , HCC mortality, with a HR value 0.65 (95% CI: 0.40-1.06). Taken together, our meta-analysis demonstrates that NSAIDs significantly reduce the incident , recurrent risk of HCC.Sulforaphane, Epigallocatechin Gallate Restore Estrogen Receptor Expression by Modulating Epigenetic Events in the Breast Cancer Cell Line MDA-MB-231: A Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis. Epigenetics refers to modifications in gene activity, expression without alteration at the DNA sequence. Environment, diet could influence gene expression. Diet modifications may be meaningful in preventing, treating chronic diseases, cancer included. Dietary bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, or epigallocatechin gallate EGCG ) or isothiocyanate (e.g., sulforaphane SFN ), can regulate histone acetylation. The aim of this systematic review, meta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of SFN, EGCG on breast cancer (BC) cells cultured in vitro. Due to the enormous variability observed in study protocols, the innumerable genes involved, only studies analyzing the number of apoptotic cells in the MDA-MB-231 cell line were evaluated. The effect size (ES) was computed as the ratio of means. We identified 7 studies, 4 regarding the effect of 10 ??M SFN on MDA-MB-231 cells (ES = 4.59, 95% confidence interval 4.05-5.20), 3 focusing on the impact of 20 ??M EGCG (ES = 2.84, 95% confidence interval 2.60-3.10). The findings suggest beneficial effects of dietary bioactive compounds such as SFN, EGCG, their effect on BC cells by restoring esr1 gene expression, modulating epigenetic changes, events,, interfering with tumor growth rate. Publication bias limits the generalizability of the conclusions. High-quality studies are needed.Intravasation of SW620 colon cancer cell spheroids through the blood endothelial barrier is inhibited by clinical drugs, flavonoids in vitro. Mechanisms how colorectal cancer (CRC) cells penetrate blood micro-vessel endothelia, metastasise is poorly understood. To study blood endothelial cell (BEC) barrier breaching by CRC emboli, an in vitro assay measuring BEC-free areas underneath SW620? cell spheroids, so called circular chemorepellent induced defects (CCIDs, appearing in consequence of endothelial retraction), was adapted, supported by Western blotting, EIA-, EROD-, luciferase reporter assays. Inhibition of ALOX12 or NF-kB in SW620? cells or BECs, respectively, caused attenuation of CCIDs. The FDA approved drugs vinpocetine inhibiting ALOX12-dependent 12(S HETE synthesis , ketotifen inhibiting NF-kB , carbamazepine, fenofibrate inhibiting 12(S HETE, NF-kB significantly attenuated CCID formation at low ??M concentrations. In the 5-FU-resistant SW620-R BEC model guanfacine, nifedipine, proadifen inhibited CCIDs stronger than in the na??ve SW620 BEC model. This indicated that in SW620-R cells formerly silent (yet unidentified) genes became expressed, targetable by these drugs in course of resistance acquisition. Fenofibrate,, the flavonoids hispidulin, apigenin, which are present in medicinal plants, spices, herbs, fruits, attenuated CCID formation in both, na??ve-, resistant models. As FDA-approved drugs, food-flavonoids inhibited established, acquired intravasative pathways, attenuated BEC barrier-breaching in vitro, this warrants testing of these compounds in CRC models in vivo.Effects of aspirin , non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the incidence of recurrent colorectal adenomas: a systematic review with meta-analysis , trial sequential analysis of r, omized clinical trials. Beneficial effects of aspirin , non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) against recurrent colorectal adenomas have been documented in systematic reviews however, the results have not been conclusive. Uncertainty remains about the appropriate dose of aspirin for adenoma prevention. The persistence of the protective effect of NSAIDs against recurrent adenomas after treatment cessation is yet to be established. Our objective was to update , systematically evaluate the evidence for aspirin , other NSAIDs on the incidence of recurrent colorectal adenomas taking into consideration the risks of r, om error , to appraise the quality of evidence using GRADE (The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development , Evaluation) approach. Retrieved trials were evaluated using Cochrane risk of bias instrument. Meta-analytic estimates were calculated with r, om-effects model , r, om errors were evaluated with trial sequential analysis (TSA). In patients with a previous history of colorectal cancer or adenomas, low-dose aspirin (80-160? mg day) compared to placebo taken for 2 to 4? years reduces the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas (relative risk (RR), 0.80 95% CI (confidence interval), 0.70-0.92 ). TSA indicated a firm evidence for this beneficial effect. The evidence indicated moderate GRADE quality. Low-dose aspirin also reduces the recurrence of advanced adenomas (RR, 0.66 95% CI, 0.44-0.99 ) however, TSA indicated lack of firm evidence for a beneficial effect. High-dose aspirin (300-325? mg day) did not statistically reduce the recurrent adenomas (RR, 0.90 95% CI, 0.68-1.18 ). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib 400? mg day) were associated with a significant decrease in the recurrence of both adenomas (RR, 0.66 95% CI, 0.59-0.72 ) , advanced adenomas (RR, 0.45 95% CI, 0.33-0.57 ). Our findings confirm the beneficial effect of low-dose aspirin on recurrence of any adenomas. COX-2 inhibitors seem to be more effective in preventing recurrence of adenomasSynthesis, biological evaluation, molecular docking studies of a new series of chalcones containing naphthalene moiety as anticancer agents. A series of chalcones containing naphthalene moiety 4a-4p have been synthesized, characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, evaluated for their in vitro anticancer activity. The majority of the screened compounds displayed potent anticancer activity against both HCT116, HepG2 human cancer cell lines. Among the series, compound 4h with a diethylamino group at the para position of the phenyl ring exhibited the most potent anticancer activity against HCT116, HepG2 cell lines with IC50 values of 1.20????????0.07, 1.02????????0.04?????M, respectively. The preliminary structure-activity relationship has been summarized. Tubulin polymerization experiments indicated that 4h effectively inhibited tubulin polymerization, flow cytometric assay revealed that 4h arrests HepG2 cells at the G2 M phase in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, molecular docking studies suggested that 4h binds to the colchicine binding site of tubulin. Inhibition of A2A Adenosine Receptor Signaling in Cancer Cells Proliferation by the Novel Antagonist TP455. Several evidences indicate that the ubiquitous nucleoside adenosine, acting through A1, A2A, A2B,, A3 receptor (AR) subtypes, plays crucial roles in tumor development. Adenosine has contrasting effects on cell proliferation depending on the engagement of different receptor subtypes in various tumors. The involvement of A2AARs in human A375 melanoma, as well as in human A549 lung, rat MRMT1 breast carcinoma proliferation has been evaluated in view of the availability of a novel A2AAR antagonist, with high affinity, selectivity, named as 2-(2-furanyl N5-(2-methoxybenzyl) 1,3 thiazolo 5,4-d pyrimidine-5,7-diammine (TP455). Specifically, the signaling pathways triggered in the cancer cells of different origin, the antagonist effect of TP455 were investigated. The A2AAR protein expression was evaluated through receptor binding assays. Furthermore, the effect of A2AAR activation on cell proliferation at 24, 48, 72 hours was studied. The selective A2AAR agonist 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine hydrochloride (CGS21680), concentration-dependently induced cell proliferation in A375, A549,, MRMT1 cancer cells, the effect was potently antagonized by the A2AAR antagonist TP455, as well as by the reference A2AAR blocker 4-(2- 7-amino-2-(2-furyl) 1,2,4 triazolo 2,3-a 1,3,5 triazin-5-ylamino ethyl)phenol (ZM241385). As for the signaling pathway recruited in this response we demonstrated that, by using the specific inhibitors of signal transduction pathways, the effect of A2AAR stimulation was induced through phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C-delta (PKC-delta). In addition, we evaluated, through the AlphaScreen SureFire phospho(p) protein assay, the kinases enrolled by A2AAR to stimulate cell proliferation, we found the involvement of protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular regulated kinases (ERK1 2),, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Indeed, we demonstrated that the CGS21680 stimulatory effect on kinases was strongly reduced in the presence of the new potent compound TP455, as well as by ZM241385, confirming the role of the A2AAR. In conclusion, the A2AAR activation stimulates proliferation of A375, A549,, MRMT1 cancer cells, importantly TP455 reveals its capability to counteract this effect, suggesting selective A2AAR antagonists as potential new therapeutics.Regulation of Polyamine Metabolism by Curcumin for Cancer Prevention, Therapy. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the natural polyphenol responsible for the characteristic yellow pigment of the spice turmeric (Curcuma longa), is traditionally known for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,, anticarcinogenic properties. Capable of affecting the initiation, promotion,, progression of carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms, curcumin has potential utility for both chemoprevention, chemotherapy. In human cancer cell lines, curcumin has been shown to decrease ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis that is frequently upregulated in cancer, other rapidly proliferating tissues. Numerous studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with curcumin can abrogate carcinogen-induced ODC activity, tumor development in rodent tumorigenesis models targeting various organs. This review summarizes the results of curcumin exposure with regard to the modulation of polyamine metabolism, discusses the potential utility of this natural compound in conjunction with the exploitation of dysregulated polyamine metabolism in chemopreventive, chemotherapeutic settings.Toxic Reactive Oxygen Species Enhanced Synergistic Combination Therapy by Self-Assembled Metal-Phenolic Network Nanoparticles. Engineering functional nanomaterials with high therapeutic efficacy, minimum side effects has increasingly become a promising strategy for cancer treatment. Herein, a ros (ROS) enhanced combination chemotherapy platform is designed via a biocompatible metal-polyphenol networks self-assembly process by encapsulating doxorubicin (DOX), platinum prodrugs in nanoparticles. Both DOX, platinum drugs can activate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases, generating superoxide radicals (O2??√å?- ). The superoxide dismutase-like activity of polyphenols can catalyze H2 O2 generation from O2??√å?- . Finally, the highly toxic HO??√å? free radicals are generated by a Fenton reaction. The ROS HO??√å? can synergize the chemotherapy by a cascade of bioreactions. Positron emission tomography imaging of 89 Zr-labeled as-prepared DOX@Pt prodrug Fe3 nanoparticles (DPPF NPs) shows prolonged blood circulation, high tumor accumulation. Furthermore, the DPPF NPs can effectively inhibit tumor growth, reduce the side effects of anticancer drugs. This study establishes a novel ROS promoted synergistic nanomedicine platform for cancer therapy. Vitexin induces G2 M???phase arrest, apoptosis via Akt mTOR signaling pathway in human glioblastoma cells. Glioblastoma is a common primary brain tumor with aggressive malignancy, which results in poor outcomes, short survival time, high mortality. Vitexin, an active ingredient from natural products, has been reported to inhibit cell growth, induce cell apoptosis in various cancer cell lines including hepatocellular carcinoma, oral, esophageal cancer. To the best of the authors knowledge, the present study was the first to investigate anticancer effects of vitexin on human glioblastoma cells, potential underlying mechanisms. The present study demonstrated that vitexin inhibited cell viability in a dose???, time???dependent manner. In the present study, vitexin induced G2 M cell cycle arrest, as demonstrated by flow cytometry. Induction of cell apoptosis following vitexin treatment, was further indicated by observation of morphological alterations, flow cytometry analysis, detection of cleaved???poly (ADP???ribose) polymerase. The present study also demonstrated that vitexin inhibited RAC???alpha serine threonine???protein kinase (Akt) mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) signaling in human glioblastoma cells. Collectively, the results of the present study demonstrated that vitexin induced G2 M cell cycle arrest, apoptosis by inhibiting Akt mTOR signaling in human glioblastoma cells. Vitexin may in the future be used as a therapeutic agent for treatment of malignant glioblastomaNanostructured Peptidotoxins as Natural Pro-Oxidants Induced Cancer Cell Death via Amplification of Oxidative Stress. Melittin (Mel), one of the host defense peptides derived from the venom of honeybees, demonstrates substantial anticancer properties, which is attributed to augmenting ros (ROS) generation. However, little has been reported on its pro-oxidation capacity in cancer oxidation therapy. In this study, an ROS amplifying nanodevice was fabricated through direct complexation of two natural pro-oxidants, Mel, condensed epigallocatechin gallate (pEGCG). The obtained nanocomplex (NC) was further covered with phenylboronic acid derivatized hyaluronic acid (pHA) through the ROS-responsive boronate ester coordination bond to produce pHA-NC. Upon undergoing receptor-mediated endocytosis into cancer cells, the inner cores of pHA-NC will be partially uncovered once pHA corona is degraded by hyaluronidase, will then escape from the lysosome by virtue of cytolytic Mel. The elevated ROS level in the tumor cytoplasm can disrupt the boronate ester bond to facilitate drug release. Both Mel, pEGCG could synergistically amplify oxidative stress, prolong ROS retention in cancer cells, leading to enhanced anticancer efficacy. This ROS cascade amplifier based on selective coordination bond, inherent pro-oxidation properties of natural ingredients could detect, elevate intracellular ROS signals, potentiating to move the tumor away from its homeostasis, make the tumor vulnerable. Compared to previously reported chemosynthetic pro-oxidants, the ROS self-sufficient system, fully composed of natural medicine, from this study provides a new insight in developing cancer oxidation therapy.Effects of polyphenols on doxorubicin-induced oral keratinocyte cytotoxicity, anticancer potency against oral cancer cells. Normal human oral keratinocytes are highly sensitive to anticancer drugs including doxorubicin. Resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate,, tannic acid are polyphenolic compounds that were reported to have cardioprotective effect when combined with doxorubicin. However, it is unknown whether these polyphenols could protect normal human oral keratinocytes against doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity without weakening its cytotoxic potential against oral cancer cells. Here, we examined the effects of the 3 polyphenolic compounds on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in normal human oral keratinocytes, also investigated their effects on doxorubicin potency in HSC-2 human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. Cell viability was evaluated, followed by the analysis of apoptosis, necrosis. The changes in intracellular ros at the early stage after treatment were also examined. The results revealed that resveratrol in combination with doxorubicin additively augmented doxorubicin cytotoxicity in both types of cells. However, epigallocatechin gallate, tannic acid at a certain concentration mitigated the doxorubicin-induced keratinocyte toxicity mainly due to reduced doxorubicin-induced necrosis in normal human oral keratinocytes without weaken doxorubicin anticancer efficacy. The exact mechanism is still unknown but intracellular ros might be not the sole factor. This study for the first time reported the effects of resveratrol, epigallocatechin gallate,, tannic acid on doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in normal oral keratinocytes, oral cancer cells. The combined use of epigallocatechin gallate or tannic acid with doxorubicin at a certain concentration could mitigate doxorubicin-induced keratinocyte cytotoxicity without weakening doxorubicin anticancer efficacy.Nutritional Compositions, Antiproliferative Activities of Different Solvent Fractions from Ethanol Extract of Cyphomandra betacea (Tamarillo) Fruit. This study aims to examine various solvent extracts of Cyphomandra betacea (tamarillo) also known as the tree tomato, for their bioactive constituents, antioxidant activity. The study also aims to examine its effect on cancer cell death using two types of cancer cell lines (liver, breast cancer cell). The first part of the study evaluates the nutritional composition of tamarillo. Then, phytochemical profiling using GC-MS analysis in ethanolic tamarillo extract was conducted. Different fractions of n-butanol, ethyl acetate, aqueous fractions were obtained from the ethanolic extract of tamarillo. Then, the fractions were subjected to the quantification of total phenol (TPC), flavonoid contents (TFC), free radical scavenging activity (SA), also antioxidant activity (AOX) assayed by beta-carotene bleaching (BCB) assay. Finally, the capability of the ethanolic extract of tamarillo, different fractions were evaluated for their anticancer properties. Findings from this study revealed that the nutritional composition (ash, protein, carbohydrate, total dietary fiber),, mineral levels (calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron) of tamarillo were moderate. The crude ethanol extract of tamarillo contained the highest phenolic, total flavonoid content. FT-IR analysis revealed the presence of alkanes, carboxylic acid, phenol, alkanes, carboxylic acids, aromatics, nitro compounds. Twelve bioactive constituents in tamarillo have been identified through GC-MS analysis. Cytotoxic activity suggests the potential of ethanolic extracts of tamarillo having a chemopreventive effect on breast, liver cancer cells. This study reveals that tamarillo has substantial antioxidant activity as well as anticancer properties.The apple polyphenol phloretin inhibits breast cancer cell migration, proliferation via inhibition of signals by type 2 glucose transporter. Human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive, poorly understood subclass of breast cancer. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are required for glucose uptake in malignant cancer cells, are ideal targets for cancer therapy. To determine whether the inhibition of GLUTs could be used in TNBC cell therapy, the apple polyphenol phloretin (Ph) was used as a specific antagonist of GLUT2 protein function in human TNBC cells. Interestingly, we found that Ph (10-150? ??M, for 24? h) inhibited cell growth, arrested the cell cycle in MDA-MB-231? cells in a p53 mutant-dependent manner, which was confirmed by pre-treatment of the cells with a p53-specific dominant-negative expression vector. We also found that Ph treatment (10-150? ??M, for 24? h) significantly decreased the migratory activity of the MDA-MB-231? cells through the inhibition of paxillin FAK, Src,, alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-sMA), through the activation of E-cadherin. Furthermore, the anti-tumorigenic effect of Ph (10, 50? mg kg or DMSO twice a week for six weeks) was demonstrated in? vivo using BALB c nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts. A decrease in N-cadherin, vimentin, an increase in p53, p21, E-cadherin were detected in the tumor tissues. In conclusion, inhibition of GLUT2 by the apple polyphenol Ph could potentially suppress TNBC tumor cell growth, metastasis. Biophysical evidence for differential gallated green tea catechins binding to membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase, its interactors. Membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is a transmembrane MMP which triggers intracellular signaling, regulates extracellular matrix proteolysis, two functions that are critical for tumor-associated angiogenesis, inflammation. While green tea catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), are considered very effective in preventing MT1-MMP-mediated functions, lack of structure-function studies, evidence regarding their direct interaction with MT1-MMP-mediated biological activities remain. Here, we assessed the impact in both cellular, biophysical assays of four ungallated catechins along with their gallated counterparts on MT1-MMP-mediated functions, molecular binding partners. Concanavalin-A (ConA) was used to trigger MT1-MMP-mediated proMMP-2 activation, expression of MT1-MMP, of endoplasmic reticulum stress biomarker GRP78 in U87 glioblastoma cells. We found that ConA-mediated MT1-MMP induction was inhibited by EGCG, catechin gallate (CG), that GRP78 induction was inhibited by EGCG, CG,, gallocatechin gallate (GCG), whereas proMMP-2 activation was inhibited by EGCG, GCG. Surface plasmon resonance was used to assess direct interaction between catechins, MT1-MMP interactors. We found that gallated catechins interacted better than their ungallated analogs with MT1-MMP as well as with MT1-MMP binding partners MMP-2, TIMP-2, MTCBP-1, LRP1-clusterIV. Overall, current structure-function evidence supports a role for the galloyl moiety in both direct, indirect interactions of green tea catechins with MT1-MMP-mediated oncogenic processes.Identification of UGTs, BCRP as potential pharmacokinetic determinants of the natural flavonoid alpinetin. Alpinetin is a natural flavonoid showing a variety of pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, hypolipidemic activities. Here, we aim to determine the roles of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in disposition of alpinetin. Glucuronidation potential of alpinetin was evaluated using pooled human liver microsomes (pHLM), pooled human intestine microsomes (pHIM), expressed UGT enzymes supplemented with the cofactor UDPGA. Activity correlation analyses with a bank of individual HLMs were performed to identify the main contributing UGT isozymes in hepatic glucuronidation of alpinetin. The effect of BCRP on alpinetin disposition was assessed using HeLa cells overexpressing UGT1A1 (HeLa1A1) cells. Alpinetin underwent extensive glucuronidation in pHLM, pHIM, generating one glucuronide metabolite. Of 12 test UGT enzymes, UGT1A3 was the most active one toward alpinetin with an intrinsic clearance (CLint???=???Vmax Km) value of 66.5?????l min nmol, followed by UGT1A1 (CLint???=???48.6?????l min nmol), UGT1A9 (CLint???=???21.0?????l min nmol), UGT2B15 (CLint???=???16.7?????l min nmol), UGT1A10 (CLint???=???1.60?????l min nmol). Glucuronidation of alpinetin was significantly correlated with glucuronidation of estradiol (an activity marker of UGT1A1), chenodeoxycholic acid (an activity marker of UGT1A3), propofol (an activity marker of UGT1A9), 5-hydroxyrofecoxib (an activity marker of UGT2B15), confirming the important roles of UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, UGT2B15 in alpinetin glucuronidation. Inhibition of BCRP by its specific inhibitor Ko143 significantly reduced excretion of alpinetin glucuronide, leading to a significant decrease in cellular glucuronidation of alpinetin. Our data suggest UGTs, BCRP as two important determinants of alpinetin pharmacokinetics.Amentoflavone is a potent broad-spectrum inhibitor of human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases. Amentoflavone (AMF), an abundant natural biflavonoid found in many medicinal plants, displays various beneficial effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-cancer. Despite the extensive studies on pharmacological activities, the toxicity or undesirable effects of AMF are rarely reported. In this study, the inhibitory effects of AMF on human UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) were carefully investigated. AMF displayed strong inhibition towards most of human UGTs including UGT1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, 1A10, 2B4, 2B17, with the IC50 values ranging from 0.12?????M to 16.81?????M. Inhibition constants (Ki) of AMF against various human UGTs varied from. Further investigation demonstrated that AMF was a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A1 mediated 4-MU-O-glucuronidation. In addition, AMF was a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A4 mediated TFP-N-glucuronidation in both UGT1A4, human liver microsomes, while functioned as a competitive inhibitor of UGT1A9 mediated propofol or 4-MU-O-glucuronidation. These findings demonstrated that AMF was a strong, broad-spectrum natural inhibitor of most human UGT. Additionally, this study provided novel insights into the underlying mechanism of AMF-associated toxicity from the perspective of UGT inhibition. Investigation of the effects of curcumin, vitamin E, their combination in cisplatin-induced testicular apoptosis using immunohistochemical technique. Cisplatin is an effective antineoplastic agent used in cancer therapy. However, the use of cisplatin is restricted due to its toxic side effects. Alleviation of its side effects which restricts cisplatin use is highly important. We aimed to investigate the effects of curcumin, vitamin E, their combination in cisplatin induced testicular apoptosis. Thirty-five Wistar albino male adult rats, weighing 300-350 g were divided randomly into five groups including seven rats in each as control, cisplatin, curcumin, vitamin E,, curcumin vitamin E. On the posttest 5th day, rats were sacrificed,, their testes were removed. 4-5 ??m sections from formalin fixed paraffin embedded testis tissues were stained both hematoxylin-eosin to analyze histologically, immunohistochemically to determine the expression of the apoptotic pathway proteins (Bax, Cas-3, Bcl-2). Increased histological damage with cisplatin administration was reduced in treatment, especially in combination therapy. Cas-3, Bax protein immunostaining intensities H-scores were significantly increased but Bcl-2 was slightly decreased in the cisplatin group compared to the control. In all treatment groups Bax, Cas-3 decreased compared to cisplatin group however Bcl-2 decreased in the curcumin, vitamin E groups. Bax Bcl-2 was the highest in the cisplatin,, decreased in all treatment groups in favor of control. Cas-3 expression increased by cisplatin administration suggests that cisplatin causes apoptosis of germ cells. According to the present findings, cisplatin mainly caused testicular apoptosis through the Cas-3, Bax apoptotic protein pathways. Cisplatin-induced testicular apoptosis can be prevented by administration of curcumin, vitamin E,, combination therapy.Natural polyphenols as sirtuin 6 modulators. Flavonoids are polyphenolic secondary metabolites synthesized by plants, fungus with various pharmacological effects. Due to their plethora of biological activities, they have been studied extensively in drug development. They have been shown to modulate the activity of a NAD -dependent histone deacetylase, SIRT6. Because SIRT6 has been implicated in longevity, metabolism, DNA-repair,, inflammatory response reduction, it is an interesting target in inflammatory, metabolic diseases as well as in cancer. Here we show, that flavonoids can alter SIRT6 activity in a structure dependent manner. Catechin derivatives with galloyl moiety displayed significant inhibition potency against SIRT6 at 10?????M concentration. The most potent SIRT6 activator, cyanidin, belonged to anthocyanidins,, produced a 55-fold increase in SIRT6 activity compared to the 3-10 fold increase for the others. Cyanidin also significantly increased SIRT6 expression in Caco-2 cells. Results from the docking studies indicated possible binding sites for the inhibitors, activators. Inhibitors likely bind in a manner that could disturb NAD binding. The putative activator binding site was found next to a loop near the acetylated peptide substrate binding site. In some cases, the activators changed the conformation of this loop suggesting that it may play a role in SIRT6 activation.Tannic Acid Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress-Mediated Apoptosis in Prostate Cancer. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an intriguing target with significant clinical importance in chemotherapy. Interference with ER functions can lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins, as detected by transmembrane sensors that instigate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Therefore, controlling induced UPR via ER stress with natural compounds could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of prostate cancer. Tannic acid (a naturally occurring polyphenol) was used to examine the ER stress mediated UPR pathway in prostate cancer cells. Tannic acid treatment inhibited the growth, clonogenic, invasive,, migratory potential of prostate cancer cells. Tannic acid demonstrated activation of ER stress response (Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1)), altered its regulatory proteins (ATF4, Bip,, PDI) expression. Tannic acid treatment affirmed upregulation of apoptosis-associated markers (Bak, Bim, cleaved caspase 3,, cleaved PARP), while downregulation of pro-survival proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL). Tannic acid exhibited elevated G??? population, due to increase in p18INK4C, p21WAF1 CIP1 expression, while cyclin D1 expression was inhibited. Reduction of MMP2, MMP9,, reinstated E-cadherin signifies the anti-metastatic potential of this compound. Altogether, these results demonstrate that tannic acid can promote apoptosis via the ER stress mediated UPR pathway, indicating a potential candidate for cancer treatment.Food polyphenols targeting peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase Pin1. We searched for inhibitors against prolyl isomerase Pin1 in order to develop functional foods to prevent, cure various Pin1 related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimers's disease,, so on. We created a polyphenol library consisting of ingredients in healthy foods, beverages, since polyphenols like epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in green tea, 974B in brown algae had been identified as its Pin1 inhibitors. Several polyphenols such as EGCG derivatives, caffeic acid derivatives, tannic acid inhibited Pin1 activity. These results provide a first step in development of the functional foods, beverage targeting Pin1, its related diseases. Synthesis, biological evaluation of alpha-bromoacryloylamido indolyl pyridinyl propenones as potent apoptotic inducers in human leukaemia cells. The combination of two pharmacophores into a single molecule represents one of the methods that can be adopted for the synthesis of new anticancer molecules. To investigate the influence of the position of the pyridine nitrogen on biological activity, two different series of alpha-bromoacryloylamido indolyl pyridinyl propenones 3a-h, 4a-d were designed, synthesized by a pharmacophore hybridization approach, evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against a panel of six human cancer cell lines. These hybrid molecules were prepared to combine the alpha-bromoacryloyl moiety with two series of indole-inspired chalcone analogues, possessing an indole derivative, a 3- or 4-pyridine ring, respectively, linked on either side of 2-propen-1-one system. The structure-activity relationship was also investigated by the insertion of alkyl or benzyl moieties at the N-1 position of the indole nucleus. We found that most of the newly synthesized displayed high antiproliferative activity against U-937, MOLT-3, K-562,, NALM-6 leukaemia cell lines, with one-digit to double-digit nanomolar IC50 values. The antiproliferative activities of 3-pyridinyl derivatives 3f-h revealed that N-benzyl indole analogues generally exhibited lower activity compared to N-H or N-alkyl derivatives 3a-b, 3c-e, respectively. Moreover, cellular mechanism studies elucidated that compound 4a induced apoptosis along with a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, activated caspase-3 in a concentration-dependent manner.ANTIOXIDANT AND CANCER CHEMOPREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES OF CISTUS AND POMEGRANATE POLYPHENOLS. Polyphenol rich extracts obtained from cistus herb (Cistus incanus L.), pomegranate peel (Punica granatum L.) exhibited significant antioxidant activity in V79 cell culture (Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts) -cistus extract reduced intracellular content of ros (ROS) by 30-40%, pomegranate extract by 29-36%. In human breast (MCF-7), colon (LOVO) cancer cell lines cistus, pomegranate extracts decreased cancer cell growth both in drug-sensitive cells by 15-30%, in drug resistant (doxorubicin-resistant DX) sublines by 5-20%. The extracts induced apoptosis in the tested cancer cell lines. Significantly higher proapoptotic impact of the extracts was observed in drug-sensitive than in drug-resistant sublines. The results suggest potential usefulness of the tested polyphenol rich extracts in people exposed to oxidative stress. Their potential use as adjuvant therapy of human cancers needs further studies.A new generation of ferrociphenols leads to a great diversity of reactive metabolites,, exhibits remarkable antiproliferative properties. Organometallic compounds bearing the redox motif ferrocenyl-ene-phenol have very promising antiproliferative properties which have been further improved by incorporating pertinent substituents able to engender new mechanisms. Here we show that novel ferrociphenols bearing a hydroxypropyl chain exhibit strong antiproliferative effects, in most cases much better than those of cisplatin, tamoxifen, or of previously described ferrociphenols devoid of this terminal OH. This is illustrated, in the case of one of these compounds, by its IC50 values of 110 nM for MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer cells, of 300 nM for cisplatin-resistant A2780cisR human ovarian cancer cells,, by its GI50 values lower than 100 nM towards a series of melanoma, renal cancer cell lines of the NCI-60 panel. Interestingly, oxidative metabolism of these hydroxypropyl-ferrociphenols yields two kinds of quinone methides (QMs) that readily react with various nucleophiles, such as glutathione, to give 1,6-, 1,8-adducts. Protonation of these quinone methides generates numerous reactive metabolites leading eventually to many rearrangement, cleavage products. This unprecedented, fully characterized metabolic profile involving a wide range of electrophilic metabolites that should react with cell macromolecules may be linked to the remarkable profile of antiproliferative activities of this new series. Indeed, the great diversity of unexpected reactive metabolites found upon oxidation will allow them to adapt to various situations present in the cancer cell. These data initiate a novel strategy for the rational design of anticancer molecules, thus opening the way to new organometallic potent anticancer drug candidates for the treatment of chemoresistant cancers.Propofol Inhibits HeLa Cells by Impairing Autophagic Flux via AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) Activation, Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Regulated by Calcium.   Propofol has antitumor effects against various cancers. However, the mechanism of action of propofol in HeLa human cervical cancer cells has not been elucidated.   We treated HeLa human cervical cancer cells with different concentrations of propofol. Cell viability was evaluated with Cell Counting Kit-8, apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate, propidium iodide staining, flow cytometry. Autophagosome formation was evaluated based on microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC)3 conversion, light chain 3 puncta formation. Autophagosome clearance was assessed according to p62 protein level, autolysosome generation.   We found that propofol decreased cell viability, increased autophagosome generation in HeLa cells. Autophagosome formation was evaluated based on LC3 conversion, LC3 puncta formation. Autophagosome clearance was assessed according to p62 protein level. The AMPK mTOR signaling pathway was found to be activated in propofol-induced autophagosome accumulation. Fluorescence analysis using LysoTracker dye revealed that propofol blocked autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Administration of rapamycin increased autophagosome clearance in propofol-treated HeLa cells. Additionally, propofol induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, disrupted intracellular Ca2 balance, thereby enhancing autophagosome accumulation. Suppressing ER stress by treatment with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) enhanced these effects, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of propofol is related to induction of ER stress.  S This study is the first to provide evidence that propofol-mediated autophagy regulation is an underlying part of the mechanism by which propofol regulates HeLa cells progression.The critical role of epigallocatechin gallate in regulating mitochondrial metabolism. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), one of polyphenols isolated from green tea, exhibits biology-benefiting effects with minimum severe adverse. EGCG is known to be a mitochondrion-targeting medicinal agent, regulating mitochondrial metabolism, including mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial bioenergetics,, mitochondria-mediated cell cycle, apoptosis. EGCG might exhibit either antioxidative activity to prevent against oxidative stress or pro-oxidative activity to counteract cancer cells, which depends on the cellular stress situations, cell types, the concentration of EGCG. Recent research has gained positive, promising data. This review will discuss the interaction between EGCG, mitochondrion.Perspectives on the recent developments with green tea polyphenols in drug discovery. Increasing evidence has expanded the role of green tea from a traditional beverage to a source of pharmacologically active molecules with diverse health benefits. However, conclusive clinical results are needed to better elucidate the cancer-preventive, therapeutic effects of green tea polyphenols (GTPs). Areas covered: The authors describe GTPs' chemical compositions, metabolic biotransformations,, their recent developments in drug discovery, focusing on their cancer chemopreventive, therapeutic effects. They then review the recent development of GTP-loaded nanoparticles, GTP prodrugs. Expert opinion: GTPs possess potent anticarcinogenic activities through interfering with the initiation, development, progression phases of cancer. There are several challenges (e.g. poor bioavailability) in developing GTPs as therapeutic agents. Use of nanoparticle-based delivery systems has provided unique advantages over purified GTPs. However, there is still a need to determine the actual magnitude, pharmacological mechanisms of GTPs encapsulated in nanoparticles, in order to address newly emerging safety issues associated with the potential 'local overdose' effect. The use of Proepigallocatechin-3-gallate (Pro-EGCG) as a prodrug appears to offer improved in vitro stability as well as better in vivo bioavailability, efficacies in a number of animal studies, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for further study, development.Selection of G1-PABA as a GPER1 ligand compared to phenol red via a ligand-based virtual screening coupled to molecular dynamics simulations, its anti-proliferative effects on breast cancer cells. Recent reports have demonstrated the role of the G protein-coupled esr1 (GPER1) on the growth, proliferation of breast cancer cells. The coupling of GPER1 to estrogen, tamoxifen or fulvestrant triggers cellular signaling pathways (PI3K, ERK) related to cell proliferation. In an effort to develop new therapeutic strategies against breast cancer, we performed an in silico study to explore the binding pose of a set of designed G15, G1 analogue compounds, including phenol red. First, we included a carboxyl group instead of the acetyl group from G1 to form amides with several moieties to increase the affinity for GPER1. Then, all the target compounds were submitted to an in silico ADMET study. Then, the ligands were coupled to GPER1 using ligand-based virtual screening to finally achieve molecular dynamics simulations of the best molecule on GPER1, as well as of phenol red, to explore its recognition properties. According to the in silico ADMET, docking studies, the best molecule was named G1-PABA ((3aS,4R,9bR 4-(6-bromobenzo d 1,3 dioxol-5-yl 3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta c quinoline-8-carboxylic acid). It was synthesized, assayed in vitro in breast cancer (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231), normal (MCF-10A) cell lines. Experimental assays showed that the target compound was able to decrease cell proliferation, showing IC50 values of 15.93 ???M, 52.92 ???M, 32.45 ???M in the MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A cell lines, respectively, after 72 h of treatment. Interestingly, the target compound showed better IC50 values without phenol red, suggesting that phenol red could interfere with the G1-PABA action at GPER, which is present in MCF-7 cells according to PCR studies, explains the cell proliferation effects. In conclusion, a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation occurred with G1-PABA in the assayed cell lines, could be due to its action on GPER1.Characterization of phenolic extracts from Brava extra virgin olive oils, their cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the phenolic profile of the 'Brava' extra virgin olive oil, assess its potential as a natural adjuvant in combination with chemotherapy treatment. The total phenol content of the phenolic extracts was 764???mg gallic acid equivalents kg, the total antioxidant capacity was 2309, 1881, 2088?????M trolox equivalents kg determined by Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical method, Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power, Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity assay, respectively. Secoiridoids comprised 83% of the total phenolic compounds. The main secoiridoid from oleuropein was the main isomer of oleuropein aglycone (74???mg kg). The main secoiridoid from ligstroside was the main isomer of ligstroside aglycone (214???mg kg). These phenolic extracts showed a significant decrease in cell viability on MCF-7 breast cancer cells in a dose, time dependent manner. 48 h-treatments with different concentrations of the extracts induced intracellular ROS generation, cell death.Curcumin Induces a Fatal Energetic Impairment in Tumor Cells in Vitro, in Vivo by Inhibiting ATP-synthase Activity. Curcumin has been reported to inhibit inflammation, tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis by decreasing cell growth, by inducing apoptosis mainly through the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkB), a master regulator of inflammation. Recent reports also indicate potential metabolic effects of the polyphenol, therefore we analyzed whether, how it affects the energy metabolism of tumor cells. We show that curcumin (10??M) inhibits the activity of ATP-synthase in isolated mitochondrial membranes leading to a dramatic drop of ATP, a reduction of oxygen consumption in in vitro, in vivo tumor models. The effects of curcumin on ATP-synthase are independent of the inhibition of NFkB since the IkB Kinase inhibitor, SC-514, does not affect ATP-synthase. The activities of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase are only slightly affected in a cell type specific manner. The energy impairment translates into decreased tumor cell viability. Moreover, curcumin induced apoptosis by promoting the generation of ros (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), a marker of lipid oxidation,, autophagy at least in part due to the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). According to the in vitro anti-tumor effect, curcumin (30mg kg body weight) significantly delayed in vivo cancer growth likely due to an energy impairment but also through the reduction of tumor angiogenesis. These results establish the ATP-synthase, a central enzyme of the cellular energy metabolism, as a target of the anti-tumoral polyphenol leading to inhibition of cancer cell growth, a general reprogramming of tumor metabolism.Identification of Estrogen Receptor alpha Antagonists from Natural Products via In Vitro, In Silico Approaches. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) is a successful target for ER-positive breast cancer, also reported to be relevant in many other diseases. Selective esr1 modulators (SERMs) make a good therapeutic effect in clinic. Because of the drug resistance, side effects of current SERMs, the discovery of new SERMs is given more, more attention. Virtual screening is a validated method to high effectively to identify novel bioactive small molecules. Ligand-based machine learning methods, structure-based molecular docking were first performed for identification of ERalpha antagonist from in-house natural product library. Naive Bayesian, recursive partitioning models with two kinds of descriptors were built, validated based on training set, test set,, external test set, then were utilized for distinction of active, inactive compounds. Totally, 162 compounds were predicted as ER antagonists, were further evaluated by molecular docking. According to docking score, we selected 8 representative compounds for both ERalpha competitor assay, luciferase reporter gene assay. Genistein, daidzein, phloretin, ellagic acid, ursolic acid, (- epigallocatechin-3-gallate, kaempferol,, naringenin exhibited different levels for antagonistic activity against ERalpha. These studies validated the feasibility of machine learning methods for predicting bioactivities of ligands, provided better insight into the natural products acting as esr1 modulator, which are important lead compounds for future new drug design.An Overview of Natural Plant Products in the Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Liver cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer, the second leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Among the liver cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma has been reported to be responsible for 85-90% of primary liver cancer, it is the second most common cause of cancer mortality with 700,000 deaths documented annually. The major risk factors of HCC include chronic infections with the hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) virus, chronic liver diseases, alcoholism as well as dietary carcinogens, such as aflatoxins. Highest incidence rates are estimated to occur in Asia, Africa. The effectiveness of current man-made agents in treating chronic liver disease is not satisfactory, they have uninvited side effects. Herbal medicines are extensively used all over the world however there is still a vast gap in accepting them by the scientific community. Plants are rich in secondary metabolites, phytochemicals obtained from both, dietary, non-dietary sources. Natural plant products are potent therapeutic as well as chemo preventive agents for numerous chronic diseases like cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative, neoplastic diseases. Dietary phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin, silibinin, N-trans-feruloyloctopamine, lycopene, emodin, caffeine, urolithin A, Phloretin have been found to be useful for the treatment of HCC, other diseases, report estimate that 60% of the anticancer medication in current use has been obtained from natural sources. Thus, derivatives from plants have played an essential role in cancer prevention due to their pleiotropic abilities to scavenge free radicals, inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis. In Vitro Antioxidant Activities of Phenols, Oleanolic Acid from Mango Peel, Their Cytotoxic Effect on A549 Cell Line. Mango peel, the main by-product of juice processing, possesses appreciable quantities of bioactive phenolic compounds, is worthy of further utilization. The present work reports for the first time the HPLC analysis, in vitro antioxidant evaluation of mango peel phenols (MPPs), their cytotoxic effect on the A549 lung cancer cell line. These results indicated that mango peel has the total phenolic content of 723.2 ?? 0.93 mgmiddotkgminus1 dry mango peel (DMP), which consisted mainly of vanillic aldehyde, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, procyanidin B???, oleanolic acid. Antioxidant assays showed that MPPs had strong antioxidant activities, with 92 ?? 4.2% of DPPH radical scavenging rate, 79 ?? 2.5% of ABTS radical inhibition rate, 4.7 ?? 0.5 muM Trolox equivalents per kgminus1 DMP of ferric reducing power. Gallic acid possess a stronger antioxidant capacity than other phenols. In vitro cytotoxic tests suggested that mango peel extract (MPE) had an IC50 value of 15 mgmiddotmLminus1, MPPs had a stronger inhibitory effect on the A549 cell line. Oleanolic acid exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity, with an IC50 value of 4.7 muM, which was similar with that of the positive control 5-fluorouracil.4'-Methoxyresveratrol Alleviated AGE-Induced Inflammation via RAGE-Mediated NF-kB, NLRP3 Inflammasome Pathway. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) could interact with the receptor for AGE (RAGE) as a sterile danger signal to induce inflammation. 4prime-methoxyresveratrol (4primeMR), a polyphenol derived from Dipterocarpaceae, has not been studied for its anti-inflammation effects. In the present study, we sought to explore the protective role of 4primeMR in AGEs-induced inflammatory model using RAW264.7 macrophages. 4primeMR significantly inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, such as interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tnf (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), as well as two typical pro-inflammatory enzymes, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2). Besides, 4primeMR significantly decreased oxidative stress, demonstrated by levels of ROS production, protein carbonyl, advanced oxidation protein product via down-regulation of NADPH oxidase. Further analysis showed that 4primeMR attenuated the RAGE overexpression induced by MGO-BSA. It also blocked the downstream signal of AGE-RAGE, particularly, MAPKs including p38, JNK,, subsequently reduced NF-kappaB activation. Additionally, 4primeMR significantly abated the activation of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome including NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, reduced the secretion of mature IL-1beta. Taken together, our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of 4primeMR is mainly through suppressing RAGE-mediated MAPK NF-kappaB signaling pathway, NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 4primeMR could be a novel therapeutic agent for inflammation-related diseases.Mitochondrial Delivery of Phenol Substructure Triggers Mitochondrial Depolarization, Apoptosis of Cancer Cells. Antitumor chemotherapy remains one of the most important challenge of the medicinal chemistry. Emerging research in chemotherapy is focused on exploiting the biochemical differences between cancer cell, normal cell metabolism in order to reduce the side effects, increase antitumor therapy efficacy. The higher mitochondrial transmembrane potential of cancer cells compared to not-transformed cells favors the intra-mitochondrial accumulation of cationic drugs in the former. This feature could be exploited to allow selective delivery of antineoplastic drugs to the cancer cells. In this work we designed, synthetized phenol derivatives joined to the triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation, a well-known vector for mitochondrial targeting. Two designed phenol TPP-derivatives 1, 2 show remarkable cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines, but were less toxic against normal cells. The differential cytotoxicity relied on the higher mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative-phosphorylation metabolism of the former. By reducing mitochondrial mass, energetic metabolism,, increasing at the same time the levels of intra-mitochondrial ros, phenol TPP-derivatives 1, 2 induced mitochondria depolarization, triggered a caspase 9 3-mediated apoptosis, limited to cancer cells. This work provides the rationale to further develop phenol TPP-derivatives targeting mitochondria as new, selective anticancer tools.Green tea polyphenol EGCG suppresses Wnt/beta-catenin signaling by promoting GSK-3beta- and PP2A-independent beta-catenin phosphorylation/degradation. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol in green tea, has been reported to inhibit the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which is aberrantly up-regulated in colorectal cancers, but its precise mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we used a sensitive cell-based system to demonstrate that EGCG suppresses beta-catenin response transcription (CRT), activated by Wnt3a-conditioned medium (Wnt3a-CM), by promoting the degradation of intracellular beta-catenin. EGCG induced beta-catenin N-terminal phosphorylation at the Ser33/37 residues and subsequently promoted its degradation however, this effect was not observed for oncogenic forms of beta-catenin. Pharmacological inhibition or depletion of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) did not abrogate the EGCG-mediated beta-catenin degradation. EGCG did not affect the activity and expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Consistently, the phosphorylation and degradation of beta-catenin was found in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutated colon cancer cells after EGCG treatment. EGCG repressed the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc, which are beta-catenin/T-cell factor-dependent genes, and inhibited the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Our findings suggest that EGCG exerts its cancer-preventive or anticancer activity against colon cancer cells by promoting the phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of beta-catenin through a mechanism independent of the GSK-3beta and PP2A.The protective role of carotenoids and polyphenols in patients with head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer is a critical global health problem and approximately 650,000 patients per year are diagnosed with this type of cancer. In addition, head and neck cancer exhibits a high recurrence rate, readily causing second primary cancers in other locations, often yielding a poor prognosis. Current medical and surgical treatment options result in considerable impairment of speaking and swallowing functions, with side effects such as nausea, vomiting, bone marrow suppression, and renal damage, thereby impairing patients' quality of life. Thus, developing a prevention and therapeutic intervention strategy for head and neck cancer is vital. Phytochemicals have been shown to have a unique ability to protect cells from damage and modulation of cell repair. The chemopreventive activities of phytochemicals have also been demonstrated to be associated with their antioxidant properties and the induction and stimulation of intercellular communication via gap junctions, which play a role in the regulation of cancer cell cycle, differentiation, apoptosis, and stagnate cancer cell growth. Phytochemicals can also regulate cancer cell signaling pathways, reduce the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells, and protect normal cells during treatment, thus reducing the damage caused by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The most studied of the chemopreventive effects of phytochemicals are the carotenoids and phenolics. In this review, we investigated the multiple mechanisms of carotenoids and polyphenols (PPs) for use in preventing head and neck cancer, reducing the side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, improving patient survival rates, and reducing the occurrence rate of second primary cancers.A new complex of curcumin with sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin: characterization studies and in vitro evaluation of cytotoxic and antioxidant activity on HepG-2 cells. Curcumin (CR) is a natural polyphenol with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties but its therapeutic potential is substantially hindered by the rather low-water solubility and bioavailability. Thus, in this work, a new soluble inclusion complex of CR with sulfobutylether-beta-cyclodextrin (SBE-beta-CD) was prepared in solution and at the solid state using different preparation techniques. Results clearly indicate that CR reacts with SBE-beta-CD to form a host-guest complex with an apparent formation constant of 1455 M(-1) . Finally, an in vitro test on a human hepatic cancer cell line (HepG-2) shows that complexation positively influences curcumin anticancer and antioxidant activity.In Vitro Approaches to Study Regulation of Hepatic Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A Expression by Paclitaxel and Rifampicin. Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide however the response rate to chemotherapy treatment remains slow, mainly due to narrow therapeutic index and multidrug resistance. Paclitaxel (taxol) has a superior outcome in terms of response rates and progression-free survival. However, numerous cancer patients are resistant to this drug. In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis that induction of cytochrome P450 (Cyp)3a11 gene by paclitaxel is downregulated by the inflammatory mediator, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, attenuates human CYP3A4 gene induction by rifampicin. Primary mouse hepatocytes were pretreated with LPS (1 ??g/ml) for 10 min, followed by paclitaxel (20 ??M) or vehicle for 24 h. RNA was extracted from the cells by trizol method followed by cDNA synthesis and analysis by real-time PCR. Paclitaxel significantly induced gene expression of Cyp3a11 (~30-fold) and this induction was attenuated in LPS-treated samples. Induction and subsequent downregulation of CYP3A enzyme can impact paclitaxel treatment in cancer patients where inflammatory mediators are activated. It has been shown that the nuclear receptor, pregnane X receptor (PXR), plays a role in the induction of CYP enzymes. In order to understand the mechanisms of regulation of human CYP3A4 gene, we co-transfected HepG2 cells (human liver cell line) with CYP3A4-luciferase construct and a PXR expression plasmid. The cells were then treated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFalpha, followed by the prototype CYP3A inducer rifampicin. It is well established that rifampicin activates PXR, leading to CYP3A4 induction. We found that induction of CYP3A4-luciferase activity by rifampicin was significantly attenuated by TNFalpha. In conclusion, we describe herein several in vitro approaches entailing primary and cultured hepatocytes, real-time PCR, and transcriptional activation (transfection) assays to investigate the molecular regulation of CYP3A, which plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of numerous chemotherapeutic drugs. Genetic or drug-induced variation in CYP3A and/or PXR expression could contribute to drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in cancer patients.Synergistic inhibition of colon cancer cell growth by a combination of atorvastatin and phloretin. Atorvastatin (ATST), a drug commonly used to reduce the levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins, is a prospective agent for the prevention of colorectal cancer in patients with hyperlipidemia. ATST in combination with functional components is a promising strategy for cancer chemoprevention. In the present study, the growth inhibitory effect of ATST combined with phloretin (PT) on SW620 and HCT116 colon cancer cells was investigated. The results of MTT assays indicated that the combination of PT and ATST markedly reduced cell survival in both cell lines compared with PT or ATST treatment administered individually. The interaction indexes between PT and ATST, which were used to analyze their interaction pattern, were computed by the median-effect equation. The interaction indexes of each PT and ATST concentration pair were <1.0, which indicated a strong synergistic effect between the two compounds. The data obtained by flow cytometry and western blot analysis of cleaved-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase indicated a synergistic effect resulted in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint. Furthermore, combined treatment with PT and ATST markedly downregulated the expression of cyclin B and upregulated the expression of phospho-cdc2 and Myt1, which suggested that the activation of cdc2 was downregulated. This combined treatment strategy enhanced the anti-cancer activity of ATST at a relatively low dosage and suggested a possible method of preventing colorectal cancer in patients with hyperlipidemia.Four new cytotoxic germacranolides from Carpesium divaricatum. In a bioassay-guided search for cytotoxic compounds from higher plants of South Korea, four new sesquiterpenes of the germacranolide type, named cardivins A (1), B (2), C (3), and D (4), have been isolated from the aerial parts of Carpesium divaricatum. Structures of these compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic techniques. Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed cytotoxicity to the human tumor cells, A-549 (nonsmall cell lung), SK-OV-3 (ovary), SK-MEL-2 (skin), XF-498 (central nervous system), and HCT-15 (colon).Curcumin and genistein: the combined effects on disease-associated CFTR mutants and their clinical implications. Genistein and curcumin are major components of Asian foods, soybean and curry turmeric respectively. These compounds have been intensively investigated for their chemical and biological features conferring their anti-cancer activity. Genistein and curcumin have also been investigated for their potentiation effects on disease-associated CFTR mutants such as ?√•√áF508 and G551D. Recently, we investigated the combined effect of genistein and curcumin on G551D-CFTR, which exhibits gating defects without abnormalities in protein synthesis or trafficking using the patch-clamp technique. We found that genistein and curcumin showed additive effects on their potentiation of G551D-CFTR in high concentration range and also, more importantly, showed a significant synergistic effect in their minimum concentration ranges. These results are consistent with the idea that multiple mechanisms are involved in the action of these CFTR potentiators. In this review, we revisit the pharmacology of genistein and curcumin on CFTR and also propose new pharmaceutical implications of combined use of these compounds in the development of drugs for CF pharmacotherapy.Anti-tumor activity of verbascoside loaded gold nanoparticles. Verbascoside (VB), a major bioactive constituent of the Tsoong herb, has attracted a great deal of attention due to its pharmacological properties. In this study, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of VB-loaded gold nanoparticles (VB-Au) on the growth of K562 cells both in vitro and in vivo. We found that, in contrast with the same concentration of gold nanoparticles (Au) or VB, VB-Au significantly decreased the viability of K562 cells and promoted the apoptosis of tumor cells. A tumor implantation mouse model further showed that the intravenous injection of VB-Au effectively inhibited the growth and induced the apoptosis of tumor cells. In conclusion, our results collectively demonstrate that VB-Au nanoparticles provide an effective strategy to control tumor cell growth.Autophagy Accompanied with Bisdemethoxycurcumin-induced Apoptosis in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Cells. To investigate the effects of bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, A549, and the highly metastatic lung cancer 95D cells. CCK-8 assay was used to assess the effect of BDMC on cytotoxicity. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate apoptosis. Western blot analysis, electron microscopy, and quantification of GFP-LC3 punctuates were used to test the effect of BDMC on autophagy and apoptosis of lung cancer cells. BDMC inhibited the viability of NSCLC cells, but had no cytotoxic effects on lung small airway epithelial cells (SAECs). The apoptotic cell death induced by BDMC was accompanied with the induction of autophagy in NSCLC cells. Blockage of autophagy by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) repressed the growth inhibitory effects and induction of apoptosis by BDMC. In addition, BDMC treatment significantly decreased smoothened (SMO) and the transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) expression. Furthermore, depletion of Gli1 by siRNA and cyclopamine (a specific SMO inhibitor) induced autophagy. Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been implicated in several human cancers, including lung cancers. The present findings provide direct evidence that BDMC-induced autophagy plays a pro-death role in NSCLC, in part, by inhibiting Hedgehog signaling.Inhibition of Breast Cancer Cell Migration by Cyclotides Isolated from Pombalia calceolaria. Two new bracelet cyclotides from roots of Pombalia calceolaria with potential anticancer activity have been characterized in this work. The cyclotides Poca A and B (1 and 2) and the previously known CyO4 (3) were de novo sequenced by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (MS). The MS2 spectra were examined and the amino acid sequences were determined. The purified peptides were tested for their cytotoxicity and effects on cell migration of MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. The isolated cyclotides reduced the number of cancer cells by more than 80% at 20 ??M, and the concentration-related cytotoxic responses were observed with IC50 values of 1.8, 2.7, and 9.8 ??M for Poca A (1), Poca B (2), and CyO4 (3), respectively. Additionally, the inhibition of cell migration (wound-healing assay) exhibited that CyO4 (3) presents an interesting activity profile, in being able to inhibit cell migration (50%) at a subtoxic concentration (2 ??M). The distribution of these cyclotides in the roots was analyzed by MALDI imaging, demonstrating that all three compounds are present in the phloem and cortical parenchyma regions.Iso-suillin from Suillus flavus Induces Apoptosis in Human Small Cell Lung Cancer H446 Cell Line. The suillin isoform iso-suillin is a natural substance isolated from a petroleum ether extract of the fruiting bodies of the mushroom Suillus flavus. Previous studies have found its inhibition effect on some cancer cells, and we aimed to study its effects on human small cell lung cancer H446 cell line. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay. Cellular morphological changes (apoptosis and necrosis) were evaluated using an electron microscope and Hoechst 33258 staining detected by the inverted microscope. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting analysis. Here, we describe the ability of iso-suillin to inhibit the growth of H446 cells in time- and dose-dependent way. Iso-suillin had no obvious impact on normal human lymphocyte proliferation at low concentrations (9.09, 18.17, or 36.35 ??mol/L) but promoted lymphocyte proliferation at a high concentration (72.70 ??mol/L). After treatment of different concentrations of iso-suillin (6.82, 13.63, or 20.45 ??mol/L), the apoptosis rate of H446 cells increased with increasing concentrations of iso-suillin (16.70%, 35.54%, and 49.20%, respectively, all P < 0.05 compared with the control), and the expression of related apoptotic proteins in the mitochondrial pathway including cytochrome c and caspase-9 were up-regulated compared with the control (all P < 0.05). On the contrary, Bcl-2/Bax ratio was down-regulated compared with the control. Besides, the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins in the death receptor apoptosis pathway, including Fas-associating protein with a novel death domain and caspase-8, and the expression of caspase-3, a downstream regulatory protein of apoptosis, were also increased compared with the control (all P < 0.05). Inhibitors of caspase-9 and caspase-8 reversed the apoptosis process in H446 cells to varying degrees. These results suggest that iso-suillin could induce H446 cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway and the death-receptor pathway. Therefore, iso-suillin might have a potential application as a novel drug for lung cancer treatment.Inhibitory effect of topical application of a green tea polyphenol fraction on tumor initiation and promotion in mouse skin. A green tea polyphenol fraction was evaluated for its ability to inhibit tumor initiation by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and tumor promotion by a phorbol ester in the skin of CD-1 mice. Topical application of the green tea polyphenol fraction inhibited benzo[a]pyrene- and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]-anthracene-induced tumor initiation as well as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced tumor promotion. Topical application of the green tea polyphenol fraction also inhibited TPA-induced inflammation, ornithine decarboxylase activity, hyperplasia and hydrogen peroxide formation. Studies with individual polyphenolic compounds in green tea indicated that topical application of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate, (-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-epicatechin gallate inhibited TPA-induced inflammation in mouse epidermis.MicroRNA-7 functions as a tumor-suppressor gene by regulating ILF2 in pancreatic carcinoma. Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2? (ILF2) has been found to be markedly upregulated in pancreatic carcinoma and is involved in the pathogenesis of pancreatic carcinoma. Thus, ILF2 may be a potential target for therapy. Yet, the regulatory mechanisms of ILF2 in pancreatic carcinoma remain largely elusive. In the present study, we demonstrated that ILF2 functioned as an oncogene and regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition? (EMT)-associated genes in pancreatic carcinoma PANC-1 cells. MicroRNA-7? (miR-7) suppressed ILF2 mRNA expression and the protein level in PANC-1 cells. Contrary to ILF2, miRNA-7 functioned as a tumor-suppressor gene and negatively regulated EMT-associated genes in the PANC-1 cells. Curcumin, a polyphenol natural product isolated from the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa, has emerged as a promising anticancer therapeutic agent. We found that treatment with curcumin increased miR-7 expression and suppressed ILF2 protein in the PANC-1 cells. Thus, we identified ILF2 as a new downstream target gene of curcumin. The results revealed that ILF2 is regulated by miR-7 and suggest that downregulation of miR-7 may be an important factor for the ILF2 overexpression in pancreatic carcinoma.Farmer to pharmacist: curcumin as an anti-invasive and antimetastatic agent for the treatment of cancer. A huge number of compounds are widely distributed in nature and many of these possess medicinal/biological/pharmacological activity. Curcumin, a polyphenol derived from the rhizomes (underground stems) of Curcuma longa Linn (a member of the ginger family, commonly known as turmeric) is a culinary spice and therapeutic used in India for thousands of years to induce color and flavor in food as well as to treat a wide array of diseases. The origin of turmeric as spice and folklore medicine is so old that it is lost in legend. Curcumin has many beneficial pharmacological effects which includes, but are not limited with, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiviral, antiangiogenic, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, and antidiabetic activities. Most importantly curcumin possesses immense antitumorigenic effect. It prevents tumor invasion and metastasis in a number of animal models, including models of lung, liver, stomach, colon, breast, esophageal cancer etc. Invasion and metastasis are considered as one of the hallmarks in cancer biology. The pertinent recent applications of curcumin as anti-invasive and antimetastatic agent in in vitro and in vivo and ex vivo studies as well as associated molecular mechanisms have been discussed in this review. Curcumin has also demonstrated the ability to improve patient outcomes in clinical trials.Xanthorrhizol induces apoptosis via the up-regulation of bax and p53 in HeLa cells. Xanthorrhizol is a sesquiterpenoid compound extracted from Curcuma xanthorrhiza, which is known locally as Temulawak. Traditionally, C. xanthorrhiza was found to have antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity. The rhizome has also been used to treat inflammation in postpartum uterine bleeding. An antiproliferative assay using methylene blue staining revealed that xanthorrhizol inhibited the proliferation of the cervical cancer cell line HeLa with an EC50 value of 6.16 microg/ml. Xanthorrhizol significantly increased apoptosis in HeLa cells, as evaluated by the Tdt-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay and nuclear morphology by Hoechst 33258 staining. Western blot analysis, which was further confirmed by the immunostaining results, implied an up-regulation of tumor suppressor protein p53 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, following the treatment with xanthorrhizol. Xanthorrhizol, however, did not affect the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2 and the viral oncoprotein, E6. Hence, xanthorrhizol is a promising antiproliferative and anticancer agent which induces p53 and Bax-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cervical cancer cells.Phytochemical Modulation of Apoptosis and Autophagy: Strategies to Overcome Chemoresistance in Leukemic Stem Cells in the Bone Marrow Microenvironment. Advances in scientific research and targeted treatment regimes have improved survival rates for many cancers over the past few decades. However, for some types of leukemia, including acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloid leukemia, mortality rates have continued to rise, with chemoresistance in leukemic stem cells (LSCs) being a major contributing factor. Most cancer drug therapies act by inducing apoptosis in dividing cells but are ineffective in targeting quiescent LSCs. Niches in the bone marrow, known as leukemic niches, behave as sanctuaries where LSCs acquire drug resistance. This review explores the role of the bone marrow environment in the maintenance of LSCs and its contribution to chemoresistance and considers current research on the potential use of phytochemicals to overcome chemoresistance through the modulation of signaling pathways involved in the survival and death of leukemic clonal cells and/or leukemic stem cells. Phytochemicals from traditional Chinese medicine, namely baicalein, chrysin, wogonin (constituents of Scutellaria baicalensis ), curcumin (a constituent of Curcuma longa), and resveratrol (a constituent of Polygonum cuspidatum h√•? zh?ng, ) have been shown to induce apoptosis in leukemic cell lines, with curcumin and resveratrol also causing cell death via the induction of autophagy (a nonapoptotic pathway). In order to be effective in eliminating LSCs, it is important to target signaling pathways (such as Wnt/beta-catenin, Notch, and Hedgehog). Resveratrol has been reported to induce apoptosis in leukemic cells through the inhibition of the Notch and Sonic hedgehog signaling pathways, therefore showing potential to affect LSCs. While these findings are of interest, there is a lack of reported research on the modulatory effect of phytochemicals on the autophagic cell death pathway in leukemia, and on the signaling pathways involved in the maintenance of LSCs, highlighting the need for further work in these areas.Curcumin reverses T cell-mediated adaptive immune dysfunctions in tumor-bearing hosts. Immune dysfunction is well documented during tumor progression and likely contributes to tumor immune evasion. CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are involved in antigen-specific tumor destruction and CD4(+) T cells are essential for helping this CD8(+) T cell-dependent tumor eradication. Tumors often target and inhibit T-cell function to escape from immune surveillance. This dysfunction includes loss of effector and memory T cells, bias towards type 2 cytokines and expansion of T regulatory (Treg) cells. Curcumin has previously been shown to have antitumor activity and some research has addressed the immunoprotective potential of this plant-derived polyphenol in tumor-bearing hosts. Here we examined the role of curcumin in the prevention of tumor-induced dysfunction of T cell-based immune responses. We observed severe loss of both effector and memory T-cell populations, downregulation of type 1 and upregulation of type 2 immune responses and decreased proliferation of effector T cells in the presence of tumors. Curcumin, in turn, prevented this loss of T cells, expanded central memory T cell (T(CM))/effector memory T cell (T(EM)) populations, reversed the type 2 immune bias and attenuated the tumor-induced inhibition of T-cell proliferation in tumor-bearing hosts. Further investigation revealed that tumor burden upregulated Treg cell populations and stimulated the production of the immunosuppressive cytokines transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-10 in these cells. Curcumin, however, inhibited the suppressive activity of Treg cells by downregulating the production of TGF-beta and IL-10 in these cells. More importantly, curcumin treatment enhanced the ability of effector T cells to kill cancer cells. Overall, our observations suggest that the unique properties of curcumin may be exploited for successful attenuation of tumor-induced suppression of cell-mediated immune responses.Curcumin and lung cancer--a review. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is the most important component of the spice turmeric and is derived from the rhizome of the East Indian plant Curcuma longa. Curcumin has been used extensively in Ayurvedic medicine for centuries, as it is nontoxic and has a variety of therapeutic properties including antioxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic activities. Recently, curcumin has been widely studied for its anticancer properties via its effects on a variety of biological pathways involved in apoptosis, tumor proliferation, chemo- and radiotherapy sensitization, tumor invasion, and metastases. Curcumin can be an effective adjunct in treating solid organ tumors due to its properties of regulating oncogenes like p53, egr-1, c-myc, bcl-XL, etc. transcription factors like NF-kB, STAT-3, and AP-1 protein kinases like MAPK and enzymes like COX and LOX. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Seventy-five percent of lung cancer presents at an advanced stage where the existing treatment is not very effective and may result in tremendous patient morbidity. As a result, there is a significant interest in developing adjunctive chemotherapies to augment currently available treatment protocols, which may allow decreased side effects and toxicity without compromising therapeutic efficacy. Curcumin is one such potential candidate, and this review presents an overview of the current in vitro and in vivo studies of curcumin in lung cancer.Frequent and simultaneous epigenetic inactivation of TP53 pathway genes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the most frequent alterations in patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Using methylation bead arrays we analyzed the methylation status of 807 genes implicated in cancer in a group of ALL samples at diagnosis . We found that 154 genes were methylated in more than 10% of ALL samples. Interestingly, the expression of 13 genes implicated in the TP53 pathway was downregulated by hypermethylation. Direct or indirect activation of TP53 pathway with 5-aza-2'-deoxycitidine, Curcumin or Nutlin-3 induced an increase in apoptosis of ALL cells. The results obtained with the initial group of 48 patients was validated retrospectively in a second cohort of 200 newly diagnosed ALL patients. Methylation of at least 1 of the 13 genes implicated in the TP53 pathway was observed in 78% of the patients, which significantly correlated with a higher relapse and mortality (p<0.001) rate being an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)  in the multivariate analysis. All these findings indicate that TP53 pathway is altered by epigenetic mechanisms in the majority of ALL patients and correlates with prognosis. Treatments with compounds that may reverse the epigenetic abnormalities or activate directly the p53 pathway represent a new therapeutic alternative for patients with ALL.Curcumin potentiates doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cardiac muscle cells through generation of reactive oxygen species. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used chemotherapy agent. The major adverse effect of DOX treatment in cancer patients is the onset of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are proposed to be responsible for DOX cardiotoxicity. Curcumin, a natural compound extracted from Curcuma Longa L., is known for its anti-oxidant properties. It has been identified as increased apoptosis in several cancer cell lines in combination with doxorubicin, but there are few studies about the effect of curcumin and doxorubicin on normal cardiac cells. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of curcumin on apoptosis induced by DOX in cardiac muscle cells. Pretreatment with curcumin significantly increased DOX-induced apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells through down regulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of caspase-8 and caspase-9. The Bax/Bcl-2 ratio increased significantly after 1h pretreatment with curcumin. As well, curcumin increases ROS generation by DOX. In response to DOX, NF-kB was activated. However, curcumin was able to inhibit NF-kB activation. In conclusion, our results indicated that pretreatment with nontoxic concentrations of curcumin sensitized H9c2 cells to DOX-mediated apoptosis by generation of ROS.Phloretin induces apoptosis of human esophageal cancer via a mitochondria-dependent pathway. 2,4,6-trihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propiophenone (phloretin) is found in apple tree leaves and the Manchurian apricot, and is a potent compound that exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumor activities. However, the effect of phloretin on esophageal cancer cells is not well-defined. The present study aimed to examine whether and how phloretin induced apoptosis in human esophageal cancer cells. EC-109 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 ??g/ml phloretin for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Cell proliferation was measured by an MTT assay. Cell apoptosis rate was measured using flow cytometric analysis subsequent to propidium iodide (PI) staining. The protein expression levels were determined by western blot analysis. It was found that phloretin significantly decreased viable cell numbers in a dose- and time-dependent manner and induced apoptosis in EC-109 cells. Additionally, phloretin exhibited potent anticancer activity in vitro, as evidenced by the downregulation of the anti-apoptosis-associated molecule B-cell lymphoma 2 (bcl-2) and an increase in the levels of the apoptosis-associated molecules bcl-2-like protein 4 and tumor protein p53. Phloretin treatment also affected the expression of apoptotic protease activating factor-1, the protein product of the direct binding of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein with low PI to the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. The present results indicated that phloretin may inhibit EC-109 cell growth by inducing apoptosis, which may be mediated through a mitochondria-dependent pathway.Formononetin inhibits neuroinflammation and increases estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) protein expression in BV2 microglia. Formononetin is a bioactive non-steroidal polyphenol found in a variety of plants. In this study we evaluated the effects of formononetin on neuroinflammation in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia. Results showed that formononetin significantly reduced the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta, nitrite and PGE2, as well as protein levels of iNOS and COX-2. Reporter gene assays showed that formononetin produced inhibition of NF-kB luciferase activity in HEK293 cells stimulated with TNF-alpha. Immunoblotting experiments revealed an inhibition of IKKalpha phosphorylation, with the resultant attenuation of phosphorylation and degradation of IkBalpha following LPS stimulation. Formononetin also produced an inhibition of nuclear translocation and DNA binding by NF-kB following LPS stimulation. RNAi experiments showed that transfection of BV2 microglia with ERbeta siRNA resulted in the loss of anti-inflammatory action of formononetin. MTT assay and MAP2 immunoreactivity experiments showed that formononetin produced significant neuroprotective activity by preventing BV2 microglia conditioned media-induced toxicity to HT22 neurons. Investigations on the effect of formononetin on MCF7 breast cancer cells revealed that, while the compound significantly increased ER-luciferase activity, its effects on proliferation were modest. This study has established that formononetin inhibits neuroinflammation by targeting NF-kB signalling pathway in BV2 microglia, possibly through mechanisms involving ERbeta. Formononetin appears to modulate ERbeta in MCF7 breast cancer cells with limited proliferative effect. Formononetin could therefore serve as a chemical scaffold for the development of novel compounds which have selective neuroprotective actions in the brain.Resveratrol inhibits Hexokinases II mediated glycolysis in non-small cell lung cancer via targeting Akt signaling pathway. Deregulation of glycolysis was often observed in human cancer cells. In the present study, we reported resveratrol, a small polyphenol, which has been intensively studied in various tumor models, has a profound anti-tumor effect on human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via regulation of glycolysis. Resveratrol impaired hexokinase II (HK2)-mediated glycolysis, and markedly inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of NSCLC cells. Exposure to resveratrol decreased EGFR and downstream kinases Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Moreover, we revealed that resveratrol impaired glucose metabolism by mainly inhibiting expression of HK2 mediated by the Akt signaling pathway, and exogenous overexpression of constitutively activated Akt1 in NSCLC cells substantially rescued resveratrol-induced glycolysis suppression. The in vivo data indicated that resveratrol obviously suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Our results suggest targeting HK2 or metabolic enzymes appears to be a new approach for clinical NSCLC prevention or treatment.Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist triptorelin and antagonist cetrorelix inhibit EGF-induced c-fos expression in human gynecological cancers. Spontaneous and epidermal growth-factor-induced proliferation of human gynecological cancer cell lines is dose- and time-dependently reduced by treatment with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist triptorelin and antagonist Cetrorelix. This antiproliferative activity is probably directly mediated through the LHRH receptors expressed by the tumor cells interacting with growth-factor-dependent mitogenic signal transduction. We have examined whether epidermal growth-factor (EGF)-induced expression of the early response gene c-fos is reduced by LHRH analogs. Human endometrial (Ishikawa, Hec-1A), ovarian (EFO-21, EFO-27, SK-OV-3), and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) were rendered quiescent by incubation (72 h) in the absence of fetal calf serum and phenol red. This was followed by a 15-min incubation in the absence or presence of the LHRH agonist triptorelin (100 nM) or the antagonist Cetrorelix (100 nM) before the cells were stimulated for 10 min with EGF (100 nM). C-fos mRNA expression was determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using a synthetic DNA fragment as internal standard. C-Fos protein synthesis was determined by SDS-PAGE and semi-quantitative Western blotting. In cells derived from endometrial and ovarian cancer, maximal c-fos mRNA expression (seven- to ninefold over basal level) was obtained 30 min after EGF stimulation. In the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 this effect was obtained 60 min after EGF treatment. In all of the lines expressing LHRH receptor, EGF-induced c-fos mRNA expression as well as c-Fos protein synthesis was dose-dependently reduced by treatment with LHRH agonists and antagonists. At 100 nM concentrations of the LHRH analogs, c-fos expression was reduced to baseline levels. No effect of LHRH analogs on EGF-induced c-fos expression was observed in the ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3, which does not express the LHRH receptor. These results suggest that the binding of LHRH agonists and antagonists to their receptors inhibits the mitogenic signal transduction pathway of the EGF receptor in endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer cell lines. The coupling of both signal transduction systems mediates the antiproliferative effect of LHRH analogs.In vitro evaluation of antiproliferative effect of ethyl gallate against human oral squamous carcinoma cell line KB. Although some polyphenols are known to possess anticancer activity against different cancer cell lines through induction of apoptosis, the mode of antiproliferative effect of ethyl gallate against human oral squamous carcinoma cell line KB was not studied until now. Therefore, the antiproliferative effect of ethyl gallate was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in comparison with the reference drug paclitaxel. Generation of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential loss, DNA damage and apoptosis were determined using 2,7-diacetyldichlorofluorescein fluorescence, uptake of rhodamine-123 by mitochondria, comet assay and acridine orange/ethidium bromide dual-dye staining method. Both ethyl gallate and paclitaxel exhibited cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentration for ethyl gallate was 30 and 20 ??g/mL for paclitaxel. A volume of 50 ??g/mL of ethyl gallate was found to be significantly effective (P < 0.05) in controlling the cancer cell proliferation leading to acute apoptosis.Comparison of inhibitory effect of curcumin nanoparticles and free curcumin in human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene expression in breast cancer. Telomerase is expressed in most cancers, including breast cancer. Curcumin, a polyphenolic compound that obtained from the herb of Curcuma longa, has many anticancer effects. But, its effect is low due to poor water solubility. In order to improve its solubility and drug delivery, we have utilized a beta-cyclodextrin-curcumin inclusion complex. To evaluate cytotoxic effects of cyclodextrin-curcumin and free curcumin, MTT assay was done. Cells were treated with equal concentration of cyclodextrin-curcumin and free curcumin. Telomerase gene expression level in two groups was compared by Real-time PCR. MTT assay demonstrated that beta-cyclodextrin-curcumin enhanced curcumin delivery in T47D breast cancer cells. The level of telomerase gene expression in cells treated with cyclodextrin-curcumin was lower than that of cells treated with free curcumin (P=0.001). RESULTS are suggesting that cyclodextrin-curcumin complex can be more effective than free curcumin in inhibition of telomerase expressionAntiproliferative effect of flavonoids from the halophyte Vitex rotundifolia on human cancer cells. Three flavonoids, luteolin (1), vitexicarpin (2) and artemetin (3), from the salt marsh plant Vitex rotundifolia, were tested for their anti-proliferative activities in AGS, MCF-7 and HT-29 human cancer cell lines and compared with the control using MTT assay. Among them, 2 was most effective with an IC50 of 6.9 and 22.8 microM against AGS and HT-29 cells, respectively. Inaddition, mRNA expression levels of major apoptosis-related genes such as p21, p53, Bcl-2 andBax in AGS cells were evaluated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compound 2 not only enhanced most remarkably the expression level of tumor suppressor genes p53 and p21, and pro-apoptotic gene Bax at a concentration of 25 microM, but also suppressed the expression level of antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 to 20% at the same concentration, thus shifting the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in favor of apoptosisLicochalcone A induces apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum stress via a phospholipase Cgamma1-, Ca(2+)-, and reactive oxygen species-dependent pathway in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Licochalcone A (LicA), an estrogenic flavonoid, induces apoptosis in multiple types of cancer cells. In this study, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer effects of LicA were investigated in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. LicA induced apoptotic cell death, activation of caspase-4, -9, and -3, and expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated proteins, including C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Inhibition of ER stress by CHOP knockdown or treatment with the ER stress inhibitors, salubrinal and 4-phenylbutyric acid, reduced LicA-induced cell death. LicA also induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine reduced LicA-induced cell death and CHOP expression. In addition, LicA increased the levels of cytosolic Ca(2+), which was blocked by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (an antagonist of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor) and BAPTA-AM (an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator). 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and BAPTA-AM inhibited LicA-induced cell death. Interestingly, LicA induced phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) and inhibition of PLCgamma1 reduced cell death and ER stress. Moreover, the multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sorafenib and sunitinib, reduced LicA-induced cell death, ER stress, and cytosolic Ca(2+) and ROS accumulation. Finally, LicA induced phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and c-Met receptor and inhibition of both receptors by co-transfection with VEGFR2 and c-Met siRNAs reversed LicA-induced cell death, Ca(2+) increase, and CHOP expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that induction of ER stress via a PLCgamma1-, Ca(2+)-, and ROS-dependent pathway may be an important mechanism by which LicA induces apoptosis in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells.Reversion effects of curcumin on multidrug resistance of MNNG/HOS human osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo through regulation of P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) encoded by ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1) gene is a kind of ATP-dependent drug transporter, which plays important roles in multidrug resistance (MDR) of human cancers, such as osteosarcoma. Curcumin is a natural phenolic coloring compound originating from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa, which is proved to possess antitumor biological activities including reversion of MDR. However, the effect and molecular mechanisms of curcumin to osteosarcoma MDR remain unclear. We established a human osteosarcoma drug-resistant cell line MNNG/HOS/MTX by pulse exposure to methotrexate (MTX) and verified that the new cell lines were cross-resistant to other anticancer agents. Then, according to the cytotoxicity assay, we reversed MDR of MNNG/HOS/MTX by 30 ??mol/L curcumin, and detected the mechanisms of curcumin reversing MDR through Real-time PCR, Western blotting assay, and Rhodamine123 (Rh123) transport test. Finally, we evaluated the effect of curcumin reversing MDR in vivo by MNNG/HOS/MTX cells xenograft-nude mice model. MNNG/HOS/MTX was proved to be a human osteosarcoma MDR cell line. MTT tumor chemosensitivity test indicates that 30 ??mol/L curcumin attenuates the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) and resistance index (RI) to MTX, diamminedichloroplatinum (DDP), adriamycin (ADM), ifosfamide (IFO), and epirubicin (EPI) in MNNG/HOS/MTX cells (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR and Western blotting assays demonstrated that curcumin down-regulated P-gp expression of MNNG/HOS/MTX cells. Rh123 transport test showed that curcumin inhibited the transport function of P-gp in vitro. In vivo studies showed that curcumin displayed the features of sensitizing antitumor drugs and inhibiting the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of osteosarcoma MDR cells. Down-regulation of P-gp and inhibition of the function of P-gp efflux pump may contribute to MDR reversion induced by curcumin in vitro and in vivo.A flavonoid glycoside isolated from Smilax china L. rhizome in vitro anticancer effects on human cancer cell lines. The anticancer activity of eight crude extracts of Smilax china L. rhizome (SCR) against HeLa cells was assessed by MTT assay and clonogenic assay, the fraction rich in flavonoids had show good activity against HeLa cells. A bioassay-guided separation on this extract lead to the detection of kaempferol-7-O-beta-D-glucoside (KG), which belongs to flavonoid glycoside, displayed marked anticancer activity. We evaluated its in vitro cytotoxicity and antiproliferative effect in a panel of established cancer cell lines by MTT assay and clonogenic assay. KG induces A375 and HL60 cells apoptosis, which was demonstrated by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation and flow cytometric analysis. Fluorescent staining with Hoechst 33258 showed fragmentation and condensation of chromatin in the A375 and HL60 cells. Flow cytometric analysis shown that A375 and HL60 cells treated with KG resulted in the appearance of a hypodiploid peak (A0 region), probably due to the presence of apoptosing cells and/or apoptotic bodies with DNA content less than 2n. Quantitation of the hypodiploid cells shows a dose-dependent response to KG, and this result is in good accordance with that of the DNA fragmentation assay by agarose gel electrophoresis. Our results suggested that cell cycle arrest at G(1) phase and induce apoptosis as a mechanism by which KG exerts an antiproliferative effect.Curcumin is an inhibitor of p300 histone acetylatransferase. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs), and p300/CBP in particular, have been implicated in cancer cell growth and survival, and as such, HATs represent novel, therapeutically relevant molecular targets for drug development. In this study, we demonstrate that the small molecule natural product curcumin, whose medicinal properties have long been recognized in India and Southeast Asia, is a selective HAT inhibitor. Furthermore the data indicate that alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl groups in the curcumin side chain function as Michael reaction sites and that the Michael reaction acceptor functionality of curcumin is required for its HAT-inhibitory activity. In cells, curcumin promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of p300 and the closely related CBP protein without affecting the HATs PCAF or GCN5. In addition to inducing p300 degradation curcumin inhibited the acetyltransferase activity of purified p300 as assessed using either histone H3 or p53 as substrate. Radiolabeled curcumin formed a covalent association with p300, and tetrahydrocurcumin displayed no p300 inhibitory activity, consistent with a Michael reaction-dependent mechanism. Finally, curcumin was able to effectively block histone hyperacetylation in both PC3-M prostate cancer cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes induced by the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275. These data thus identify the medicinal natural product curcumin as a novel lead compound for development of possibly therapeutic, p300/CBP-specific HAT inhibitors.Curcumin inhibits trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid-induced colitis in rats by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Curcumin is a widely used spice with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. It has been reported that curcumin held therapeutic effects on experimental colitis by inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a nuclear receptor with anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects and its activation may inhibit the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. Several studies have shown that PPARgamma ligands had an important therapeutic effect in colitis. However there is no report about the alteration of PPARgamma in trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis treated with curcumin. In this study, we administered curcumin (30 mg/kg/day) by intraperitoneal injection immediately after colitis was induced and the injection lasted for two weeks. have evaluated the effects of curcumin on the colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS). Curcumin (30 mg/kg d) was administered by intraperitoneal just after colitis was induced and lasted for two weeks. Therapeutic effects of dexamethasone (Dex, 2 mg/kg d) alone and the combined effects of curcumin+Dex were also examined. We found that curcumin improved long-term survival rate of disease-bearing rats, promoted rat body weight recovery, and decreased macroscopic scores of the colitis. The expression levels of PPARgamma, 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) and prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) were all increased, but the expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was decreased in rats after administration of curcumin. Treatment with Dex improved PPARgamma expression and inhibited the expression of COX-2, 15d-PGJ(2) and PGE(2). Combined effects of curcumin+Dex were similar to that of Dex. In summary, curcumin showed therapeutic effects on TNBS-induced colitis and the mechanisms by which curcumin exerts its effects may involve activation of PPARgamma and its ligands.Resistance to apoptosis of HCW-2 cells can be overcome by curcumin- or vincristine-induced mitotic catastrophe. The term mitotic catastrophe has recently become widely used to describe a form of death affecting many cancer cells, which, because of severe DNA or mitotic spindle damage, are not able to bypass mitosis. We show here that cells of the HL-60-derived HCW-2 line highly resistant to apoptosis, upon treatment with curcumin or vincristine, undergo mitotic catastrophe that is finalized by caspase 3 activation and oligonucleosomal DNA degradation. Curcumin is a natural dye, derived from Curcuma longa that has been shown to induce cell death in many cancer cells. Both treatments decrease cell proliferation and cell survival, arrest cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and induce morphological changes characterized by cell enlargement and micronucleation. Catastrophic cells comprise a separate subpopulation with less than 4C DNA, as evidenced by flow and scanning cytometry. This subpopulation is MPM-2 positive. Thymidine block increased the number of cell arrested in the G2/M phase of cell cycle and curcumin effectiveness as an inducer of mitotic catastrophe. Curcumin, but not vincristine, acts on HCW-2 cells by inhibiting the expression of survivin, a modulator of cell division and apoptosis in cancer. Altogether our results show that apoptosis resistance can be overcome by inducing mitotic catastrophe in HCW-2 cells.Inhibitory effects of curcumin on protein kinase C activity induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate in NIH 3T3 cells. Curcumin is a dietary pigment responsible for the yellow color of curry. It is a potent inhibitor of tumor promotion induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in mouse skin. When mouse fibroblast cells (NIH 3T3) were treated with TPA alone, protein kinase C (PKC) translocated from the cytosolic fraction to the particulate fraction. Treatment with 15 or 20 microns curcumin for 15 min inhibited TPA-induced PKC activity in particulate fraction by 26 or 60% and did not affect the level of PKC protein. Curcumin also inhibited PKC activity in both cytosolic and particulate fractions in vitro by competing with phosphatidylserine. However, the inhibitory effect of curcumin was reduced after preincubation with the thiol compounds. These findings suggest that the suppression of PKC activity may contribute to the molecular mechanism of inhibition of TPA-induced tumor promotion by curcumin.Isoliquiritigenin inhibits the growth of prostate cancer. Isoliquiritigenin, one of the components in the root of Glycyrrhiza glabra L., is a member of the flavonoids, which are known to have an anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effect of isoliquiritigenin on prostate cancer in vitro. DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines were used as targets. We examined the effects of isoliquiritigenin on cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation and cell cycle-regulating gene expression. Further, we investigated the effects of isoliquiritigenin on the GADD153 mRNA and protein expression, and promoter activity. Isoliquiritigenin significantly inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis indicated that isoliquiritigenin induced S and G2/M phase arrest. Isoliquiritigenin enhanced the expression of GADD153 mRNA and protein associated with cell cycle arrest. Further, isoliquiritigenin stimulated transcriptional activity of GADD153 promoter dose-dependently. These findings suggest that isoliquiritigenin is a candidate agent for the treatment of prostate cancer and GADD153 may play an important role in isoliquiritigenin-induced cell cycle arrest and cell growth inhibition.Ethanolic Extract of Bark from Salix aegyptiaca Ameliorates 1,2-dimethylhydrazine-induced Colon Carcinogenesis in Mice by Reducing Oxidative Stress. We have previously shown that ethanolic extract from bark (EEB) of Salix aegyptiaca (Musk Willow) can inhibit proliferation and motility and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Tandem mass spectrometry revealed EEB to be rich in catechin, catechol, and salicin. The present study investigated the chemopreventive effect of HPLC-fingerprinted EEB on 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation in mice. DMH (20 mg/kg body weight) was weekly injected subcutaneously to mice for the first 2 weeks. EEB (100 and 400 mg/kg body weight) was provided orally from the 7th to 14th week, after which colon tissues were evaluated histologically and biochemically. DMH treatment induced high number of ACF EEB significantly reduced the number and multiplicity of ACF, along with a restoration in goblet cells and mucin accumulation. EEB supplementation improved the markers of inflammation (myeloperoxidase and neutrophil infiltration) and oxidative stress. More importantly, EEB amplified apoptosis of neoplastic cells in the colon mucosa of DMH-treated mice. It also lowered levels of markers for early transformation events such as EGFR, nuclear beta-catenin, and COX-2 in colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and HCT-116. The innocuity of EEB (up to 1600 mg/kg) to mice reinforces its potential as a chemopreventive agent.In Vitro Anticancer Activity of a Nonpolar Fraction from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino. Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino (GpM) has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of various diseases including cancer. Most previous studies have focused primarily on polar fractions of GpM for anticancer activities. In this study, a nonpolar fraction EA1.3A from GpM showed potent growth inhibitory activities against four cancer cell lines with IC50 ranging from 31.62√å√∂√å√Ñ√å¬™??g/mL to 38.02√å√∂√å√Ñ√å¬™??g/mL. Furthermore, EA1.3A also inhibited the growth of breast cancer cell MDA-MB-453 time-dependently, as well as its colony formation ability. EA1.3A induced apoptosis on MDA-MB-453 cells both dose-dependently and time-dependently as analyzed by flow cytometry and verified by western blotting analysis of apoptosis marker cleaved nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (cPARP). Additionally, EA1.3A induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Chemical components analysis of EA1.3A by GC-MS revealed that this nonpolar fraction from GpM contains 10 compounds including four alkaloids, three organic esters, two terpenes, and one catechol substance, and all these compounds have not been reported in GpM. In summary, the nonpolar fraction EA1.3A from GpM inhibited cancer cell growth through induction of apoptosis and regulation of cell cycle progression. Our study shed light on new chemical bases for the anticancer activities of GpM and feasibilities to develop new anticancer agents from this widely used medicinal plant.Antiproliferative and Antiestrogenic Activities of Bonediol an Alkyl Catechol from Bonellia macrocarpa. The purpose of this study was to investigate antiproliferative activity of bonediol, an alkyl catechol isolated from the Mayan medicinal plant Bonellia macrocarpa. Bonediol was assessed for growth inhibition of androgen-sensitive (LNCaP), androgen-insensitive (PC-3), and metastatic androgen-insensitive (PC-3M) human prostate tumor cells toxicity on normal cell line (HEK 293) was also evaluated. Hedgehog pathway was evaluated and competitive 3H-estradiol ligand binding assay was performed. Additionally, antioxidant activity on Nrf2-ARE pathway was evaluated. Bonediol induced a growth inhibition on prostate cancer cell lines (IC50 from 8.5 to 20.6). Interestingly, bonediol binds to both estrogen receptors (ERalpha  and ERbeta) and displaces the native ligand E2 (17beta-estradiol). No significant activity was found in the Hedgehog pathway. Additionally, activity of bonediol on Nrf2-ARE pathway suggested that bonediol could induce oxidative stress and activation of detoxification enzymes. We propose that the compound bonediol may serve as a potential chemopreventive treatment with therapeutic potential against prostate cancer.One-pot laccase-catalysed synthesis of 5,6-dihydroxylated benzo[b]furans and catechol derivatives, and their anticancer activity. A commercial laccase, Suberase?√•? from Novozymes, was used to catalyse the synthesis of 5,6-dihydroxylated benzo[b]furans and catechol derivatives. The yields were, in some cases, similar to or better than that obtained by other enzymatic, chemical or electrochemical syntheses. The synthesised derivatives were screened against renal (TK10), melanoma (UACC62), breast (MCF7) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines. GI50, TGI and LC50 are reported for the first time. Anticancer screening showed that the cytostatic effects of the 5,6-dihydroxylated benzo[b]furans were most effective against the melanoma (UACC62) cancer cell line with several compounds exhibiting potent growth inhibitory activities, of which two compounds had better activity than the anticancer agent etoposide . One compound exhibited potent activity against the renal (TK10) cancer cell line and two exhibited potent activity  against the breast (MCF7) cancer cell line. These results encourage further studies of the 5,6-dihydroxylated benzo[b]furans for their potential application in anticancer therapy.Idaein chloride induced p53 dependent apoptosis in cervical cancer cells through inhibition of viral oncoproteins. Host dependent expression of early HPV oncoproteins, E6 and E7 play central role in the formation of cervical carcinoma. Presently, we have shown that the cyanidin analog, idaein chloride treatment induced dose dependent apoptosis (IC50?√å√ô=?√å√ô2.579?√å√ô??g/ml) in HPV positive - HeLa cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed arrest of cell cycle at G1 phase with an increased sub G1 cell population on 12th h of exposure. The recorded reduced expression levels of cell cycle proteins - cyclin D, cdk 4 and cdk 6 confirmed the occurrence of cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. In addition, the idaein chloride significantly inhibited the expression of E6 and E7 proteins, resulting in p53 re-expression and hence triggering of p53 dependent apoptosis. This has been further supported by the recorded variations in the expression patterns of p21/WAF, pRb and E2F regulatory proteins. In case of mitochondrial apoptotic markers, the expression of Bax was restored and Bcl-2 level got decreased at 12th h. Cleaved caspases 3  9 and PARP were also observed after 3?√å√ôh of treatment. Interestingly, the epigenetic regulatory enzymes (DNMTs) were inhibited by idaein chloride. Thus, idaein chloride could be a potent source for developing a drug against cervical carcinoma.Anti-septic effects of pelargonidin on HMGB1-induced responses in vitro and in vivo. A certain nucleosomal protein-high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1)-has recently been established as a late mediator of sepsis, with a relatively wide therapeutic window for pharmacological intervention. Pelargonidin (PEL) is a well-known red pigment found in plants it has important biological activities that are potentially beneficial for human health. In the present study, we investigated whether PEL can modulate HMGB1-mediated inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in mice. The anti-inflammatory activities of PEL were determined by measuring permeability, leukocyte adhesion and migration, and activation of pro-inflammatory proteins in HMGB1-activated HUVECs and mice, as well as the beneficial effects of PEL on survival rate in the mouse sepsis model. The data showed that PEL had effectively inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of HMGB1 and suppressed HMGB1-mediated septic responses, such as hyperpermeability, adhesion and migration of leukocytes, and expression of cell adhesion molecules. Furthermore, PEL inhibited the HMGB1-mediated production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), as well as the activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Collectively, these results indicate that PEL could be used to treat various severe vascular inflammatory diseases via the inhibition of the HMGB1 signaling pathwayTriterpene glycosides and other polar constituents of shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) kernels and their bioactivities. The MeOH extract of defatted shea (Vitellaria paradoxa Sapotaceae) kernels was investigated for its constituents, and fifteen oleanane-type triterpene acids and glycosides, two steroid glucosides, two pentane-2,4-diol glucosides, seven phenolic compounds, and three sugars, were isolated. The structures of five triterpene glycosides were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical methods. Upon evaluation of the bioactivity of the isolated compounds, it was found that some or most of the compounds have potent or moderate inhibitory activities against the following: melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells induced by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) generation of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals, against Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12-O-teradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells t TPA-induced inflammation in mice, and proliferation of one or more of HL-60, A549, AZ521, and SK-BR-3 human cancer cell lines, respectively. Western blot analysis established that paradoxoside E inhibits melanogenesis by regulation of expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, and tyrosinase-related protein-1 (TRP-1) and TRP-2. In addition, tieghemelin A was demonstrated to exhibit cytotoxic activity against A549 cells (IC50 13.5 ??M) mainly due to induction of apoptosis by flow cytometry. The extract of defatted shea kernels and its constituents may be, therefore, valuable as potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, skin-whitening, chemopreventive, and anticancer agents.Purification and characterization of a novel antitumor protein with antioxidant and deoxyribonuclease activity from edible mushroom Pholiota nameko. A novel antitumor protein from the edible mushroom Pholiota nameko (PNAP) was purified through a two-step chromatographic procedure including SP cation exchange chromatogram and Superdex gel filtration. The approximate molecular weight was demonstrated to be 18.5?√å√ôkDa by SDS-PAGE and ultracentrifugation analysis and N-terminal sequence was detected as AGRTFIGYNG by Edman degradation. Biochemical characterization showed that it exhibited significant antioxidant activity by effectively scavenging hydroxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals compared to standard antioxidant butylated hydroxy anisole. PNAP had deoxyribonuclease activity with the optimum pH and temperature were 5.0 and 60?√å√ô??C respectively, as well as it can act on both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA, but preferentially on double-stranded DNA. PNAP displayed antitumor activity against cancer cell lines such as MCF7 and Hela cells. Human breast cancer MCF7 cells treated with PNAP produced typical apoptotic morphological changes including chromatin condensation, accumulation of sub-G1 cells and alternation of mitochondrial permeability. The PNAP induced apoptosis of MCF7 cells entailed loss of mitochondrial membrane potential resulting in release of cytochrome c into cytosol, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which are responsible for the execution of apoptosis, implying intrinsic signal pathway is involved in PNAP induced apoptosis.Antioxidant and anticancer activity of extract from Betula platyphylla var. japonica. The antioxidant and anticancer properties of a medicinal plant, Betula platyphylla var. japonica were investigated. The total methanol extract of B. platyphylla var. japonica had protective effects against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (V79-4) cell line and induced apoptotic cell death in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, a cancer cell line. B. platyphylla var. japonica extract significantly increased cell viability against H2O2. The extract also showed high 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity (IC50 2.4 microg/ml) and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity (IC50 below 4.0 microg/ml). Furthermore, B. platyphylla var. japonica extract reduced the number of V79-4 cells arrested in G2/M in response to H2O2 treatment and increased the activities of several cellular antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Treatment with B. platyphylla var. japonica extract induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HL-60 cells, as shown by nucleosomal DNA fragmentation, increases in the subdiploid cell population, and fluorescence microscopy. B. platyphylla var. japonica extract gradually increased the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and led to the activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of PARP. These findings suggest that B. platyphylla var. japonica exhibits potential antioxidant and anticancer properties.Carvacrol Induces Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-mediated Apoptosis Along with Cell Cycle Arrest at G0/G1 in Human Prostate Cancer Cells. Carvacrol, a major monoterpenoid phenol from Origanum and Thymus species, has been shown to exhibit antiproliferative and anticancer properties in a few recent studies. Nevertheless, detailed mechanism of the action of this compound in prostate cancer has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, in the current study, we examined the anticancer activity and mechanism of the action of carvacrol against human prostate cancer cells. It was found that the treatment of DU145 cells with carvacrol decreased cell viability in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The antiproliferative action of carvacrol leads to induction of apoptosis as confirmed by nuclear condensation, Annexin V-FITC/PI positive cells, and caspase-3 activation. In addition, carvacrol augmented reactive oxygen species generation and disruption in the mitochondrial membrane potential which has not been reported in the previous studies of carvacrol with prostate cancer. Moreover, carvacrol-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells was also accompanied by significant amount of growth arrest at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle which has also not been documented previously. To sum up, this study has established that carvacrol could be a promising chemotherapeutic agent and could have a direct practical implication and translational relevance to prostate cancer patients as Origanum consumption may retard prostate cancer progression.Effect of alkylaminophenols on growth inhibition and apoptosis of bone cancer cells. In this work, we report the anticancer properties of a series of 11 chemically synthesized alkylaminophenols against human osteosarcoma U2OS tumor cell line. Several assays including cytotoxicity, inhibitor kinetic study, cell migration, Annexin-V/PI double staining, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and caspase 3/7 assays were conducted on this cell line. Cytotoxic 2-((3,4-dihydroquinolin-1(2H)-yl)(p-tolyl)methyl)phenol was determined to have an IC50 value of 36.6M against U2OS cells and it also inhibits the cell growth in time-dependent manner. The potent activity of lead compound against the growth of multiple cell lines, U2OS, MG-65 and HEK-293T, confirms the osteosarcoma cell specific inhibition. Further studies indicated that such compound is an inhibitor of metastatic property of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis agent. The ability of increasing ROS and inducing caspases 3 and 7 further confirm the contribution of programmed cell death in U2OS and HEK-293T cells. Additionally, four compounds based on the 2-(indolin-1-yl(aryl)methyl)-4-nitrophenol core were also identified to be cytotoxic with IC50 values in the 66-88 range. This work further demonstrates the anticancer properties of phenol derivatives, adding one more entry to the collection of promising chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment.Pleuropterus multiflorus (Hasuo) mediated straightforward eco-friendly synthesis of silver, gold nanoparticles and evaluation of their anti-cancer activity on A549 lung cancer cell line. Pleuropterus multiflorus (Hasuo) is a widely used medicinal plant in Korea and China for treating amnesia, isnomia, heart throbbing etc. With the constructive idea of promoting the wide-spread usage of P. multiflorus, we propose its indirect usage in the form of biologically active silver (Pm-AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (Pm-AuNPs). The synthesized nanoparticles were predominantly spherical, crystalline with the Z-average hydrodynamic diameter of 274.8nm and 104.8nm respectively. Also, proteins and phenols were identified as the major players involved in their synthesis and stability. Further, Pm-AgNPs at 25 were significantly cytotoxic to lung cancer cells, whereas, Pm-AuNPs were not cytotoxic to both normal keratinocyte and lung cancer cells even at 100. In addition, further evaluation of the anti-cancer activity of these new nanoparticles, such as migration and apoptosis, shown that Pm-AgNPs have a potential therapeutic effect on A549 lung cancer cell treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report dissecting out the ability of the endemic P. multiflorus for the synthesis of bioactive silver and gold nanoparticle which would open up doors for its extensive usage in medicinal field.Oleocanthal exerts antitumor effects on human liver and colon cancer cells through ROS generation. The beneficial health properties of the Mediter-ranean diet are well recognized. The principle source of fat in Mediterranean diet is extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). Oleocanthal (OC) is a naturally occurring minor phenolic compound isolated from EVOO, which has shown a potent anti-inflammatory activity, by means of its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes COX-1 and COX-2. A large body of evidence indicates that phenols exhibit anticancer activities. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential anticancer effects of OC in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC) models. A panel of human HCC (HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5) and CRC (HT29, SW480) cell lines was used. Cells were treated with OC, and cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated. Compared with classical commercially available COX inhibitors (ibuprofen, indomethacin, nimesulide), OC was more effective in inducing cell growth inhibition in HCC and CRC cells. Moreover, OC inhibited colony formation and induced apoptosis, as confirmed by PARP cleavage, activation of caspases 3/7 and chromatin condensation. OC treatment in a dose dependent-manner induced expression of gammaH2AX, a marker of DNA damage, increased intracellular ROS production and caused mitochondrial depolarization. Moreover, the effects of OC were suppressed by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Finally, OC was not toxic in primary normal human hepatocytes. In conclusion, OC treatment was found to exert a potent anticancer activity against HCC and CRC cells. Taken together, our findings provide preclinical support of the chemotherapeutic potential of EVOO against cancer.Hydroquinone analog 4-[(Tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl) oxy]√å√ôphenol induces C26 colon cancer cell apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in√å√ôvivo. The 4[(Tetrahydro-pyran-yl) oxy] phenol (XG-d) hydroquinone analog, is found in Vaccinium vitis-idaea L. Although it is known for its antioxidant properties and high level of safety, its antitumor activity remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the anticancer effect of XG-d was determined in√å√ôvitro and in√å√ôvivo. The cytotoxicity of XG-d against C26 murine colon carcinoma cells was found to occur in a time and concentration-dependent manner, whereas little effect was observed in the two normal cell lines (HK-2 and L02) investigated. Oral administration of XG-d (100√å√ômg/kg) had effects on the tumor growth of tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, marked apoptosis was observed using Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometric analysis with annexin√å√ôpropidium iodide double staining. XG-d also downregulated the expression of B cell lymphoma√å√ô2 (Bcl-2), increased the expression levels of Bcl-2-associated √å√ôprotein and activated caspase-9, caspase-3 and poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase. The present study demonstrated for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that XG-d inhibited cancer cell growth via the induction of apoptosis and was also able to inhibit tumor growth in√å√ôvivo. These results demonstrated that XG-d may be used as a potential natural agent for cancer therapy with low toxicity.GRIM-mediated Stat3 activation is a determinant for resveratrol-induced proliferation and cytotoxicity in cervical tumor-derived cell lines. Resveratrol is a natural phenol, produced from red grapes, berries and peanuts. Previous studies have suggested that resveratrol exerts anticancer effects. Activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is important in cancer. However, the mechanisms by which resveratrol suppresses the Stat3 signaling pathway remain to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on GRIM-Stat3 signaling in HeLa cells, derived from a cervical tumor. HeLa cells were divided into experimental groups and treated with resveratrol. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression levels of Stat3, Stat3, GRIM and betaactin. Cell viability was determined using an MTT assay. The results showed that 100  resveratrol suppressed the proliferation and Stat3 phosphorylation in HeLa cells, and induced the expression of the gene associated with retinoid-induced mortality 19 (GRIM19) protein. Overexpression of GRIM19 suppressed the Stat3 signaling pathway in HeLa cells. The Stat3 signaling pathway was activated following the downregulation of GRIM19 expression using short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Resveratrol suppressed cell proliferation, however, this effect was decreased through the use of siRNAs. The suppression of Stat3 phosphorylation by resveratrol decreased following treatment with siRNAs. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is among the first to identify GRIM19, Stat3 signaling as a target of resveratrol, and further elucidates the mechanisms underlying the antitumor activity of resveratrol.Norcantharidin enhances ABT-737-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by transcriptional repression of Mcl-1. Small-molecule cell-permeable Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist ABT-737 has recently emerged as a novel cancer therapeutic agent because it potently induces apoptosis in certain cancer cells. However, since ABT-737 binds to Mcl-1 with low affinity, ABT-737-mediated apoptosis signaling is inhibited in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and other solid cancer cells due to the elevated expression of Mcl-1. Accordingly, strategies that target Mcl-1 are explored for overcoming ABT-737-resistance. In this study, we reported that Norcantharidin (NCTD), a small-molecule anticancer drug derived from Chinese traditional medicine blister beetle (Mylabris), induced transcriptional repression of Mcl-1 and considerably enhanced ABT-737-triggered cell viability inhibition and apoptosis in multiple HCC cell lines. Moreover, we observed that the enhancement of ABT-737-mediated apoptosis by NCTD was associated with activation of mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway, which involved cytosolic release of cytochrome c, cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Additionally, knockdown of Bax/Bak, the key effectors permeabilizing mitochondrial outer membrane significantly attenuated the enhancement, indicating mitochondrial apoptosis pathway played an essential role in the execution of the apoptosis. Finally, knockdown of Mcl-1 substantially potentiated ABT-737-mediated apoptotic cell death, confirming the potency of Mcl-1 repression by NCTD in enhancing ABT-737-induced apoptosis. These results therefore suggest that combination treatment with NCTD can overcome ABT-737 resistance and enhance ABT-737 therapeutic efficacy in treating human HCC.Murraya koenigii leaf extract inhibits proteasome activity and induces cell death in breast cancer cells. Inhibition of the proteolytic activity of 26S proteasome, the protein-degrading machine, is now considered a novel and promising approach for cancer therapy. Interestingly, proteasome inhibitors have been demonstrated to selectively kill cancer cells and also enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Recently, polyphenols/flavonoids have been reported to inhibit proteasome activity. Murraya koenigii Spreng, a medicinally important herb of Indian origin, has been used for centuries in the Ayurvedic system of medicine. Here we show that Murraya koenigii leaves (curry leaves), a rich source of polyphenols, inhibit the proteolytic activity of the cancer cell proteasome, and cause cell death. Hydro-methanolic extract of curry leaves (CLE) was prepared and its total phenolic content [TPC] determined by, the Folin-Ciocalteau's method. Two human breast carcinoma cell lines: MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and a normal human lung fibroblast cell line, WI-38 were used for the studies. Cytotoxicity of the CLE was assessed by the MTT assay. We studied the effect of CLE on growth kinetics using colony formation assay. Growth arrest was assessed by cell cycle analysis and apoptosis by Annexin-V binding using flow cytometry. Inhibition of the endogenous 26S proteasome was studied in intact cells and cell extracts using substrates specific to 20S proteasomal enzymes. CLE decreased cell viability and altered the growth kinetics in both the breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. It showed a significant arrest of cells in the S phase albeit in cancer cells only. Annexin V binding data suggests that cell death was via the apoptotic pathway in both the cancer cell lines. CLE treatment significantly decreased the activity of the 26S proteasome in the cancer but not normal cells. Our study suggests M. koenigii leaves to be a potent source of proteasome inhibitors that lead to cancer cell death. Therefore, identification of active component(s) from the leaf extract could lead to the development of anti-cancer agents which could be useful in the treatment of different types of cancers.Resveratrol induces MMP-9 and cell migration via the p38 kinase and PI-3K pathways in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. Trans-3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene (resveratrol) is a grape polyphenol present in various plants, food products, red wine and grapes. Resveratrol has anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, anti-oxidant and anti-aging properties. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key enzymes involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix,  and their expression may be regulated in cancer metastasis. In the present study,  we aimed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on MMPs and cell migration, and to understand the mechanism of action in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells. We found that resveratrol inhibited HT1080 cell viability at various concentrations as detected by the MTT assay and FACS analysis. However, resveratrol dramatically increased the activation and expression of MMP-9 in a dose-and time-dependent  manner, as determined by gelatin zymography assay and western blot analysis. We also discovered that resveratrol enhanced the migratory ability of HT1080 cells,  as determined by the wound healing assay, and decreased the phosphorylation of  p38 kinase. Moreover, the Akt kinase was inhibited by resveratrol in the HT1080 cells. The inhibition of p38 and Akt kinases with SB203580 and LY294002 further increased resveratrol-induced MMP-9 as well as cell migration in the HT1080 cells. Our results suggest that resveratrol regulates MMP-9 and migratory abilities through the p38 kinase and PI-3K pathways in HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells.Genistein, a soy phytoestrogen, prevents the growth of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells induced by 17beta-estradiol or bisphenol A via the inhibition of cell cycle progression. An endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) is a global health concern. In this study, we examined the effects of genistein (GEN) on bisphenol A (BPA) or 17beta-estradiol (E2)-induced cell growth and gene alterations of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). In an in vitro cell viability assay, E2 or BPA significantly increased the growth of BG-1 cells. This increased proliferative activity was reversed by treatment with ICI? 182,780, a well-known ER antagonist, while cell proliferation was further promoted in the presence of propyl pyrazole triol (PPT), an ERalpha agonist. These results imply that cell proliferation increased by E2 or BPA was mediated by ERs, particularly ERalpha. BPA clearly acted as a xenoestrogen in BG-1 ovarian cancer cells by mimicking E2 action. In contrast, GEN effectively suppressed BG-1 cell proliferation promoted by E2 or BPA by inhibiting cell cycle progression. E2 and BPA increased the expression of cyclin D1, a factor responsible for the G1/S cell cycle transition. They also decreased the expression of p21, a potent cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that arrests the cell cycle in G1 phase, and promoted the proliferation of BG-1 cells. As shown by its repressive effect on cell growth, GEN decreased the expression of cyclin D1 augmented by E2 or BPA. On the other hand, GEN increased the p21 expression downregulated by E2 or BPA. Collectively, our findings suggest that GEN, a dietary phytoestrogen, has an inhibitory effect on the growth of estrogen-dependent cancers promoted by E2 or BPA.Apoptotic effects of protocatechuic acid in human breast, lung, liver, cervix, and prostate cancer cells: potential mechanisms of action. Apoptotic effects of protocatechuic acid (PCA) at 1, 2, 4, 8 micromol/L on human breast cancer MCF7 cell, lung cancer A549 cell, HepG2 cell, cervix HeLa cell, and prostate cancer LNCaP cell were examined. Results showed that PCA concentration-dependently decreased cell viability, increased lactate dehydrogenase leakage, enhanced DNA fragmentation, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and lowered Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity for these cancer cells (P < 0.05). PCA also concentration-dependently elevated caspase-3 activity in five cancer cells (P < 0.05), but this agent at 2-8 micromol/L significantly increased caspase-8 activity (P < 0.05). PCA concentration-dependently decreased intercellular adhesion molecule level in test cancer cells (P < 0.05) but significantly inhibited cell adhesion at 2-8 micromol/L (P < 0.05). PCA also concentration-dependently lowered the levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 in five cancer cells (P < 0.05), but this agent at 2-8 micromol/L significantly suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor production (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that PCA is a potent anticancer agent to cause apoptosis or retard invasion and metastasis in these five cancer cells.Inhibition of Stat3 signaling pathway by nifuroxazide improves antitumor immunity and impairs colorectal carcinoma metastasis. Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the one of the most common cancers with considerable metastatic potential, explaining the need for new drug candidates that inhibit tumor metastasis. The signal transducers and activators of the transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway has an important role in CRC and has been validated as a promising anticancer target for CRC therapy. In the present study, we report our findings on nifuroxazide, an antidiarrheal agent identified as an inhibitor of Stat3. Our studies showed that nifuroxazide decreased the viability of three CRC cell lines and induced apoptosis of cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, western blot analysis demonstrated that the occurrence of its apoptosis was correlated with the activation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and decreased the expression of Bcl-2. In addition, nifuroxazide markedly impaired CRC cell migration and invasion by downregulating phosphorylated-Stat3Tyr705, and also impaired the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Furthermore, our studies showed that nifuroxazide also significantly inhibited the tumor metastasis in lung and abdomen metastasis models of colon cancer. Meanwhile, nifuroxazide functionally reduced the proliferation index, induced tumor apoptosis and impaired metastasis. Notably, nifuroxazide reduced the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the blood, spleens and tumors, accompanied by the increased infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumors. Importantly, a marked decrease in the number of M2-type macrophages in tumor in the abdomen metastasis model was also observed. Taken together, our results indicated that nifuroxazide could effectively inhibit tumor metastasis by mediating Stat3 pathway and it might have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of CRC.Biological activities of phenolic compounds and triterpenoids from the galls of Terminalia chebula. Nine phenolic compounds, including two phenolic carboxylic acids, 1 and 2, seven hydrolyzable tannins, 3-9, eight triterpenoids, including four oleanane-type triterpene acids, 10-13, and four of their glucosides, 14-17, isolated from a MeOH extract of the gall of Terminalia chebula Retz. (myrobalan tree Combretaceae), were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells induced by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), against the Epstein-Barr virus early antigen (EBV-EA) activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in Raji cells, and against TPA-induced inflammation in mice. Their 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activities and cytotoxic activities against four human cancer cell lines were also evaluated. Compounds 6-9 and 12 exhibited potent inhibitory activities against melanogenesis (39.3-66.3% melanin content) with low toxicity to the cells (74.5-105.9% cell viability) at a concentration of 10 ??M. Western-blot analysis revealed that isoterchebulin (8) reduced the protein levels of MITF (=microphtalmia-associated transcription factor), tyrosinase, and TRP-1 (=tyrosine-related protein 1), mostly in a concentration-dependent manner. Eight triterpenoids, 10-17, showed potent inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction with the IC50 values in the range of 269-363 mol ratio/32 pmol TPA, while these compounds exhibited no DPPH scavenging activities (IC50 >100 ??M). On the other hand, the nine phenolic compounds, 1-9, exhibited potent radical-scavenging activities (IC50 1.4-10.9 ??M) with weak inhibitory effects on EBV-EA induction (IC50 460-518 mol ratio/32 pmol TPA). The tannin 6 and seven triterpenoids, 10-16, have been shown to inhibit TPA-induced inflammation (1) in mice with the ID50 values in the range of 0.06-0.33. Arjungenin (10) exhibited inhibitory effect on skin-tumor promotion in an in vivo two-stage mouse-skin carcinogenesis test based on 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) as initiator and with TPA as promoter. Compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-9, 12, and 13, against HL60 cell line, compounds 1 and 4, against AZ521 cell line, and compounds 1, 11, and 12, against SK-BR-3 cell line, showed moderate cytotoxic activitiesHispidulin mediates apoptosis in human renal cell carcinoma by inducing ceramide accumulation. Hispidulin, a polyphenolic flavonoid extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant S involucrata, exhibits anti-tumor effects in a wide array of human cancer cells, mainly through growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest. However, its precise anticancer mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that contribute to hispidulin-induced apoptosis of human clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) lines Caki-2 and ACHN. Hispidulin (10, 20 ??mol/L) decreased the viability of ccRCC cells in dose- and time-dependent manners without affecting that of normal tubular epithelial cells. Moreover, hispidulin treatment dose-dependently increased the levels of cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-9, but the inhibitors of caspase-8 and caspase-9 only partly abrogated hispidulin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that hispidulin triggered apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Moreover, hispidulin treatment significantly inhibited the activity of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and consequently promoted ceramide accumulation, thus leading to apoptosis of the cancer cells, whereas pretreatment with K6PC-5, an activator of SphK1, or overexpression of SphK1 significantly attenuated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of hispidulin. In addition, hispidulin treatment dose-dependently activated ROS/JNK signaling and led to cell apoptosis. We further demonstrated in Caki-2 xenograft nude mice that injection of hispidulin (20, 40 mg?√å√õkg-1?√å√õd-1, ip) dose-dependently suppressed tumor growth accompanied by decreased SphK1 activity and increased ceramide accumulation in tumor tissues. Our findings reveal a new explanation for the anti-tumor mechanisms of hispidulin, and suggest that SphK1 and ceramide may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of ccRCCIn vitro effects and the related molecular mechanism of galangin and quercetin on human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901). Natural flavonoids are proven to be powerful against various cancers, but few studies have investigated the potential effects of two flavonoids galangin and quercetin on a human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901). In vitro growth inhibition and apoptosis of the two flavonoids on the SGC-7901 cells as well as potential mechanism about apoptosis induction are reported in the present study. The assaying results showed that the two flavonoids at 40-200 mmol/L for 24-72 hours conferred lower cell viability of 14.1-90.3% in dose- and time-dependent manner, and at 160 for 24-48 hours enhanced the proportion of apoptotic cells into 13.3-27.4% and 40.6-65.6%, respectively. Galangin was more powerful than quercetin to inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis and decrease mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Oligonucleotide micro array, real-time RT-PCR and Western-blot analyses revealed expression changes of the genes and proteins in the treated cells, clarifying a mechanism related to apoptosis induction. The two flavonoids activated caspase-8, which cleaved Bid into tBid simultaneously, Bax transferred from cytosol into mitochondria to decrease MMP consequentially, cytochrome c released from mitochondria activated caspase-9, and then caspase-9 activated caspase-3, which executed the apoptosis. That is, the apoptosis occurred via a mitochondrial pathway involving caspase-8/Bid/Bax activation.Curcumin inhibits the proliferation and induces apoptosis in HT-29 cell lines through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanism. Curcumin, a natural pigment extracted from Curcuma longa, has anti-carcinogenic activities in many cancer cell lines. The molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by curcumin are still unknown. In the current study, we investigated the roles of reactive oxygen species in curcumin stimulated apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Curcumin significantly reduced cell viability, induced apoptosis, activated caspase-3 activity and stimulated concentration-dependent release of ROS. Inhibition of ROS generation by scavengers suppressed apoptosis and Bcl-2 expression induced by curcumin, indicating the critical roles of ROS in the apoptotic process. However, caspase-3 inhibitor (z-VAD-FMK) couldn't completely inhibit the curcumin induced apoptosis, indicating ROS mediated apoptosis may be caspase-independent. Together, our findings showed that ROS played significant roles in the apoptosis induced by curcumin in HT-29 cellsCurcumin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis in human papillary thyroid carcinoma BCPAP cells via disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine tumor. Our previous studies have demonstrated that curcumin can induce apoptosis in human papillary thyroid carcinoma BCPAP cells. However, the underlined mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major organelle for synthesis, maturation, and folding proteins as well as a large store for Ca. Overcoming chronically activated ER stress by triggering pro-apoptotic pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is a novel strategy for cancer therapeutics. Our study aimed to uncover the ER stress pathway involved in the apoptosis caused by curcumin. BCPAP cells were treated with different doses of curcumin (12.5-50√å√ì√å√†√å¬¨??M). Annexin V/PI double staining was used to determine cell apoptosis. Rhod-2/AM calcium fluorescence probe assay was performed to measure the calcium level of endoplasmic reticulum. Western blot was used to examine the expression of ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein 10 (CHOP) and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). X-box binding protein1 (XBP-1) spliced form was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Curcumin significantly inhibited anchorage-independent cell growth and induced apoptosis in BCPAP cells. Curcumin induced ER stress and UPR responses in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) partially reversed the antigrowth activity of curcumin. Moreover, curcumin significantly increased inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IRE1alpha) phosphorylation and XBP-1 mRNA splicing to induce a subsets of ER chaperones. Increased cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), which enhances expression of its downstream target CHOP was also observed. Furthermore, curcumin induced intracellular Ca influx through inhibition of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase 2A (SERCA2) pump. The increased cytosolic Ca then bound to calmodulin to activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling, leading to mitochondrial apoptosis pathway activation. Ca chelator BAPTA partially reversed curcumin-induced ER stress and growth suppression, confirming the possible involvement of calcium homeostasis disruption in this response. Curcumin inhibits thyroid cancer cell growth, at least partially, through ER stress-associated apoptosis. Our observations provoked that ER stress activation may be a promising therapeutic target for thyroid cancer treatment.Curcuminoids combined with gefitinib mediated apoptosis and autophagy of human oral cancer SAS cells in vitro and reduced tumor of SAS cell xenograft mice in vivo. Gefitinib has been used for cancer patients and curcumin (CUR), demethoxycurcumin (DMC), or bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) also shown to induce cancer cell apoptosis. However, no report shows the combination of gefitinib with, CUR, DMC, or BDMC induce cell apoptosis and autophagy in human oral cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of gefitinib with or without CUR, DMC, or BDMC co-treatment on the cell viability, apoptotic cell death, autophagy, mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), and caspase-3 activities by flow cytometry assay and autophagy by acridine orange (AO) staining in human oral cancer SAS cells. Results indicated that gefitinib co-treated with CUR, DMC, or BDMC decreased total viable cell number through the induction of cell apoptosis and autophagy and decreased the levels of MMP and increased caspase-3 activities in SAS cells. Western blotting indicated that gefitinib combined with CUR, DMC, or BDMC led to decrease Bcl-2 protein expression which is an antiapoptotic protein and to increase ATG5, Beclin 1, p62/SQSTM1, and LC3 expression that associated with cell autophagy in SAS cells. Gefitinib combined with CUR and DMC led to significantly reduce the tumor weights and volumes in SAS cell xenograft nude mice but did not affect the total body weights. Based on those observations, we suggest that the combination of gefitinib with CUR, DMC, and BDMC can be a potential anticancer agent for human oral cancer in future.Curcumin enhances the anti-cancer effects of Paris Saponin II in lung cancer cells. To investigate the synergistic mechanisms of Paris Saponin II (PSII) and Curcumin (CUR) in lung cancer. The combination changed the cellular uptake of CUR and PSII, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and cytokine levels were analysed on different lung cancer cells. The combination displayed a synergistic anti-cancer effect through promoting the cellular uptake of CUR on different lung cancer cells. Hoechst H33258 staining and FACS assay indicated that the combination of PSII and CUR induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blot and cytokine antibody microarray suggested that the combination activated death receptors such as DR6, CD40/CD40L, FasL and TNF-alpha to induce cancer cells apoptosis, and up-regulated IGFBP-1 leading to inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway and increase of p21 and p27, which therefore induced a G2 phase arrest in NCI-H446 cells. Meanwhile, the combination suppressed PCNA and NF-kB pathway in 4 kinds of lung cancer cells. They activated the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK, and inhibited PI3K in NCI-H460 and NCI-H446 cells, enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK in NCI-H1299 cells, and increased the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, and suppressed PI3K in NCI-H520 cells. PSII combined with CUR had a synergistic anti-cancer effect on lung cancer cells. These findings provided a rationale for using the combination of curcumin and PSII in the treatment of lung cancer in future.Curcumin suppresses proliferation and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer by modulation of MTA1-mediated Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Curcumin, a naturally occurring phenolic compound, has a diversity of antitumor activities. It has been previously demonstrated that curcumin can inhibit the invasion and metastasis of tumors through activation of the tumor suppressor DnaJ-like heat shock protein 40 (HLJ1). However, the specific roles and mechanisms of curcumin in regulating the malignant behaviors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells still remain unclear. In this study, we found that curcumin could inhibit the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells and induce G0/G1 phase arrest. Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) overexpression has been detected in a wide variety of aggressive tumors and plays an important role on cell invasion and metastasis. Our results showed that curcumin could effectively inhibit the MTA1 expression of NSCLC cells. Further research on the subsequent mechanism showed that curcumin inhibited the proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells through MTA1-mediated inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was reported to play a critical cooperative role on promoting lung tumorigenesis. Thus, these investigations provided novel insights into the mechanisms of curcumin on inhibition of NSCLC cell growth and invasion and showed potential therapeutic strategies for NSCLC.Curcumin inhibits tumor growth and angiogenesis in an orthotopic mouse model of human pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a malignant neoplasm originating from transformed cells arising in tissues forming the pancreas. The best chemotherapeutic agent used to treat pancreatic cancer is the gemcitabine. However, gemcitabine treatment is associated with many side effects. Thus novel strategies involving less toxic agents for treatment of pancreatic cancer are necessary. Curcumin is one such agent that inhibits the proliferation and angiogenesis of a wide variety of tumor cells, through the modulation of many cell signalling pathways. In this study, we investigated whether curcumin plays antitumor effects in MIA PaCa-2 cells. In vitro studies showed that curcumin inhibits the proliferation and enhances apoptosis of MIA PaCa-2 cells. To test whether the antitumor activity of curcumin is also observed in vivo, we generated an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer by injection of MIA PaCa-2 cells in nude mice. We placed mice on diet containing curcumin at 0.6% for 6 weeks. In these treated mice tumors were smaller with respect to controls and showed a downregulation of the transcription nuclear factor NF-kB and NF-kB-regulated gene products. Overall, our data indicate that curcumin has a great potential in treatment of human pancreatic cancer through the modulation of NF-kB pathway.Cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activities of leaf extract of Croton bonplandianus Baill. against lung cancer cell line A549. The acetone extract (AcE) of the Croton bonplandianus Baill., an exotic weed of the Euphorbiaceae family was studied for cytotoxicity, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest in A549 cell line and antioxidant capacities using MTT assay, acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB staining), cell cycle analysis and DPPH radical scavenging assay respectively. Based on the cytotoxic activity, the extract was tested for the apoptotic effect using AO/EB and Hoechst 33258 staining. The apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Further, to determine the stage of cell death, cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry and AcE was found to arrest G2/M phase in a dose dependent manner. The number of cells in G2/M phase increases with concurrent accumulation of cells in sub G√å√ì√å¬©√å√†/G√å√ì√å¬©\\u0081phase indicates the induction of apoptosis at G2M phase. The free radical scavenging activity of the AcE against DPPH was considerably significant. The cytotoxic, apoptotic and antioxidant effect of the AcE could be well correlated with the presence of potent free radical scavenging secondary metabolites such as phenols (43 ? 0.05 g/mL), flavonoids (3.5 ? 0.07 √å¬Åg/mL) and tannin (0.36 ? 0.1 √å¬Åg/mL). Our study has shown that A549 cells were more sensitive to AcE with an I of 15.68 ? 0.006 √å¬Åg/mL compared to the standard drug 2.20 ? 0.008 g/mL (cisplatin). The results suggest that Croton bonplandianus could serve as a potential source of alternative therapeutic agent for treating cancer. Further research is required to isolate the active principle compound and determination of its anticancer property.Antitumor activity of the novel flavonoid Oncamex in preclinical breast cancer models. The natural polyphenol myricetin induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in preclinical cancer models. We hypothesised that myricetin-derived flavonoids with enhanced redox properties, improved cell uptake and mitochondrial targeting might have increased potential as antitumor agents. We studied the effect of a second-generation flavonoid analogue Oncamex in a panel of seven breast cancer cell lines, applying western blotting, gene expression analysis, fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry of xenograft tissue to investigate its mechanism of action. Proliferation assays showed that Oncamex treatment for 8√å√ì√å√†√å√áh reduced cell viability and induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, concomitant with increased caspase activation. Microarray analysis showed that Oncamex was associated with changes in the expression of genes controlling cell cycle and apoptosis. Fluorescence microscopy showed the compound's mitochondrial targeting and reactive oxygen species-modulating properties, inducing superoxide production at concentrations associated with antiproliferative effects. A preliminary in vivo study in mice implanted with the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft showed that Oncamex inhibited tumor growth, reducing tissue viability and Ki-67 proliferation, with no signs of untoward effects on the animals. Oncamex is a novel flavonoid capable of specific mitochondrial delivery and redox modulation. It has shown antitumor activity in preclinical models of breast cancer, supporting the potential of this prototypic candidate for its continued development as an anticancer agent.Inhibition of breast cancer cell survival by Xanthohumol via modulation of the Notch signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro. Natural compounds derived from plants have been an important source of numerous clinically useful anticancer agents. Nevertheless, limited studies indicate that xanthohumol (XN), a major prenylated flavonoid in hop plants (Humulus lupulus), may possess anticarcinogenic properties. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the antitumorigenic effects and the underlying mechanism of XN on breast cancer in vivo and in vitro. A 4T1 breast tumor mouse model was used in the present study to investigate XN suppression of tumor growth as detected by tumorigenicity assays in vivo. In addition, in vitro studies revealed that XN significantly decreased cell viability, induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as confirmed by an MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis, indicating anticarcinogenic activity of XN against breast cancer. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the inactivation of the Notch signaling pathway, Notch 1 and Ki-67, in vivo consistently, XN caused decreased activation of the Notch signaling pathway and apoptotic regulators B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-extra large and caspase 3, as determined by western blot analysis in vitro. This study suggests that XN may potentially be useful as a chemopreventive agent during breast hyperplasia and carcinogenesis, acting via the regulation of Notch associated apoptotic regulators in vivo and in vitro.Phloretin induces apoptosis in H-Ras MCF10A human breast tumor cells through the activation of p53 via JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Mutations in Ras play a critical role in the development of human cancers, including breast cancer. We investigated the possible antiproliferative effects of the naturally occurring dihydrochalcone phloretin [2',4',6'-trihydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propiophenone] on H-Ras-transformed MCF10A human breast epithelial (H-Ras MCF10A) cells. Phloretin suppressed H-Ras MCF10A cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and induced nuclear condensation in the cells, indicating that phloretin-induced cell death occurs mainly via the induction of apoptosis. Prominent upregulation of p53 and Bax and cleavage of poly (ADP)-ribose polymerase were also detected in the phloretin-treated cells. Finally, phloretin markedly increased caspase-3 activity as well as JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. Our findings suggest that the phloretin-induced apoptosis of breast tumor cells contributes to the chemopreventive potential of phloretin against breast cancer.Coumarin-chalcone hybrid instigates DNA damage by minor groove binding and stabilizes p53 through post translational modifications. S009-131, a coumarin-chalcone hybrid, had been shown to possess anti-proliferative and anti-tumor effect by triggering apoptosis. In this report, we investigated role of DNA damage signalling pathway in S009-131 induced cancer cell death. Here we show that S009-131 causes DNA damage by potential binding to the minor groove which led to the phosphorylation and activation of ATM and DNA-PK, but not ATR, at earlier time points in order to initiate repair process. S009-131 induced DNA damage response triggered activation of p53 through phosphorylation at its key residues. Pharmacological inhibition of PIKKs abrogated S009-131 induced phosphorylation of p53 at Ser 15. DNA damage induced phosphorylation resulted in reduced proteasomal degradation of p53 by disrupting p53-MDM2 interaction. Additionally, our docking studies revealed that S009-131 might also contribute to increased cellular p53 level by occupying p53 binding pocket of MDM2. Posttranslational modifications of p53 upon S009-131 treatment led to enhanced affinity of p53 towards responsive elements (p53-RE) in the promoter regions of target genes and increased transcriptional efficiency. Together, the results suggest that S009-131 cleaves DNA through minor groove binding and eventually activates PIKKs associated DNA damage response signalling to promote stabilization and enhanced transcriptional activity of p53 through posttranslational modifications at key residues.Dihydroartemisinin inhibits endothelial cell proliferation through the suppression of the ERK signaling pathway. Disrupting tumor angiogenesis serves as an important strategy for cancer therapy. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, has exhibited potent anti-angiogenic activity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully understood. The present study aimed to investigate the role of DHA on endothelial cell proliferation, the essential process in angiogenesis. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with DHA were examined for proliferation, apoptosis and activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Proliferation of HUVECs was inhibited by 20 √•¬µM DHA without induction of apoptosis. DHA also reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of ERK1/2 in HUVECs. In addition, DHA suppressed the transcription and protein expression of ERK1/2 downstream effectors c-Fos and c-Myc. Electrical cell-substrate impedance sensing real-time analysis demonstrated that ERK signaling inhibitor PD98059 comprises the anti-proliferative effects of DHA. Thus, DHA inhibits endothelial cell proliferation by suppressing the ERK signaling pathway. The present study strengthened the potential of DHA as an angiogenesis inhibitor for cancer treatment.Three dimensional staging of breast cancer. Breast cancers are three dimensional solids but very few are spherical. We hypothesized that calculations based on the greatest diameter would not accurately reflect tumor volume, that three dimensional measurements would affect tumor staging. 165 invasive carcinomas measuring 2.5 cm or less, having three measured diameters (a > or = b > or = c) noted were evaluated. Tumor volume was calculated using four geometric models: the spherical 4 3 pi (a 2)3, prolate spheroid 4 3 pi (a 2) (c 2)2, oblate spheroid 4 3 pi (a 2)2 (b 2),, ellipsoid 4 3 pi (a 2 x b 2 x c 2). The ellipsoid correctly determined the volume for any tumor shape. All cases were stratified according to the TNM staging system. Differences in mean volume calculated as a sphere, ellipsoid for each tumor subclass were analyzed using Student's T test. The reclassification of tumors by the ellipsoid formula was determined. Seventy-six (46.1%) had tumors with three different diameters while only six (3.6%) were true spheres having three identical diameters. Mean tumor volume analysis of T1a, T1b, T1c,, T2 tumors demonstrated a statistically significant overestimation of volume when utilizing the sphere formula instead of the ellipsoid formula (p < 0.05). The differences in volume were more dramatic as the diameters increased. A total of 41 tumors were moved into smaller T subclasses including 10 node positive patients. Tumor volume analysis demonstrates that use of only the greatest diameter poorly reflects the true volume of a lesion, consistently overestimates volume. The ellipsoid formula accurately calculates volume for these three dimensional tumors, when utilized has significant relevance to staging small invasive breast cancers.Relative risk of malignant tumors in analgesic abusers. Effects of long-term intake of aspirin. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) e.g. aspirin, indomethacin are reported in epidemiological, experimental studies to reduce the risk for colo-rectal cancer, potentially other malignant tumors. We examined the effect of NSAIDs on tumor prevalence in abusers of mixed analgesics containing aspirin, phenacetine, caffeine or codein. 618 analgesic abusers who were autopsied between 1968-1983 were compared with a control group without evidence of analgesic abuse matched for sex, age, year autopsy was performed. Abusers were found to have an overall risk of 0.40 fold of having developed a malignancy as compared with the controls. Excluding patients with urinary tract tumors which are increased in analgesic abusers the risk was further decreased to 0.28. No statistically significant effect was found for patients with prostate cancer. The results encourage prospective control studies in high risk patients.Total intravenous anesthesia for two patients complicated with myotonic dystrophy. Total intravenous anesthesia with propofol, fentanyl, ketamine (PFK) was given to two patients complicated with myotonic dystrophy. Case-1: A 42-year-old female underwent a hemithyroidectomy. Anesthesia was induced slowly with intravenous ketamine 20 mg, propofol 60 mg. Her tracheal intubation was performed smoothly without any muscle relaxants. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion of 5 mg.kg-1.h-1, ketamine infusion of 0.3 mg.kg-1.h-1, fentanyl 200 micrograms in total. She regained consciousness 20 minutes after the end of propofol infusion,, 15 minutes later, her trachea was extubated without any troubles. Case-2: A 41-year-old female underwent a removal of left parotid tumor. Anesthesia was induced slowly with ketamine 40 mg, propofol 100 mg intravenously. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol infusion of 5-10 mg.kg-1.h-1, ketamine infusion of 0.5 mg.kg-1.h-1, fentanyl 350 micrograms in total. No muscle relaxant was used through the surgical procedure. Emergence from anesthesia was observed 10 minutes after the end of propofol infusion, her trachea was extubated. When a nasogastric tube was pulled out, her respiration stopped suddenly, she was intubated again only for two hours without any troubles. In both cases their serum CPK levels, rectal temperatures were very stable. PFK method would be a choice for patients with myotonic dystrophy.Development, disappearance of tolerance to induction of interferon, tnf response in athletes treated with natural immunostimulant. The effect of nonspecific immunostimulation was examined in 15 basketball players subjected to extensive physical effort. The To√å√â¬â√õ?pa* Torf Preparation (TTP*), a natural immunostimulating drug, was applied orally, one 5 mg tablet daily, in two 21-day cycles, separated by 2-week hiatus. Blood samples were collected 4 times, after each of two TTP* cycles, after the first, second hiatus. Whole blood assay was used to determine the spontaneous, induced production of interferon (IFN), tnf (TNF). The levels of the cytokines were measured by microbioassays. TTP* stimulated synthesis of IFN, TNF in the whole blood cultures. However, after the oral administraton of TTP* for 3 weeks the leukocytes of the athletes developed hyporeactivity to IFN induction by TTP*, to a lesser extent to another superinducer--a mixture of phytohemagglutinin, bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The hyporeactivity state disappeared spontaneously within 2 weeks. In contrast, the tolerance to TNF induction did not develop during the TTP* administration. The increase of immunoglobulins, mainly of IgM, IgG classes, an acute phase protein--alpha1-antitrypsin, was observed at the late phase of the treatment. We suggest that the cytokine levels may be early markers for immunoprophylaxis. Furthermore, high production of IFN, TNF may be associated with extensive physical effort.Redox cycling of phenol induces oxidative stress in epidermal keratinocytes. A variety of phenolic compounds are utilized for industrial production of phenol-formaldehyde resins, paints, lacquers, cosmetics,, pharmaceuticals. Skin exposure to industrial phenolics is known to cause skin rash, dermal inflammation, contact dermatitis, leucoderma,, cancer promotion. The biochemical mechanisms of cytotoxicity of phenolic compounds are not well understood. We hypothesized that enzymatic one-electron oxidation of phenolic compounds resulting in the generation of phenoxyl radicals may be an important contributor to the cytotoxic effects. Phenoxyl radicals are readily reduced by thiols, ascorbate,, other intracellular reductants (e.g., NADH, NADPH) regenerating the parent phenolic compound. Hence, phenolic compounds may undergo enzymatically driven redox-cycling thus causing oxidative stress. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed endogenous thiols, lipid peroxidation,, total antioxidant reserves in normal human keratinocytes exposed to phenol. Using a newly developed cis-parinaric acid-based procedure to assay site-specific oxidative stress in membrane phospholipids, we found that phenol at subtoxic concentrations (50 microM) caused oxidation of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine (but not of phosphatidylserine) in keratinocytes.  Incubation of ascorbate-preloaded keratinocytes with phenol produced an electron paramagnetic resonance-detectable signal of ascorbate radicals, suggesting that redox-cycling of one-electron oxidation products of phenol, its phenoxyl radicals, is involved in the oxidative effects. As no cytotoxicity was observed in keratinocytes exposed to 50 microM or 500 microM phenol, we conclude that phenol at subtoxic concentrations causes significant oxidative stress.How is the liver primed or sensitized for alcoholic liver disease? This article represents the proceedings of a symposium at the 2000 ISBRA Meeting in Yokohama, Japan. The chairs were. The presentations were Dysregulated TNF signaling in alcoholic liver disease.

Due to some severe side effects classical hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is currently being challenged by a therapy with phytoestrogens. Particularly soy, red clover derived isoflavones are advertised as selective esr1 modulators (SERMs) with only desired, no undesired estrogenic effects. Evidence that this is the case however is scarce. Most studies investigating climacteric complaints did not find beneficial effects. A proposed beneficial effect on mammary cancer is unproven. The majority of studies indicate that a putative beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system are questionable due to the fact that estradiol which--like isoflavones--increase HDL, decrease LDL concentrations appear not to prevent arteriosclerosis in the human. In the urogenital tract, including the vagina, soy, red clover derived isoflavones are without effects. Prostate cancer, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: systematic review, meta-analysis. Animal, laboratory studies suggest that regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce prostate cancer risk. To assess this association, we conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis of observational studies published before January 2003. We derived summary odds_ratio (ORs) using both fixed, random effects models, performed subgroup analyses to explore the possible sources of heterogeneity between combined studies. We identified 12 reports (five retrospective, seven prospective studies). Most studies of aspirin use reported inverse associations, but only two were statistically significant. The summary OR for the association between aspirin use, prostate cancer was 0.9 (95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.99 test of homogeneity P=0.32),, varied from 1.0 for retrospective studies to 0.85 for prospective studies. Studies that measured exposure to a mixture of NSAIDs were less consistent. The current epidemiological evidence and, in particular, the strong, consistent laboratory evidence underline the need for additional epidemiological studies to confirm the direction, magnitude of the association.Red clover isoflavones in practice: a clinician's view. The subject of phytoestrogen use must be seen against the background of increasing controversy surrounding the role of hormone replacement therapy. Phytoestrogens such as those derived from red clover may help with hot flushes, which are a common menopausal complaint. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend its use for bone protection in a group of women who are at high risk.Anesthetic management with propofol during pheochromocytoma resection under bispectral index monitoring. In three patients undergoing pheochromocytoma resection under propofol fentanyl anesthesia, bispectral index (BIS) was monitored for assessment of hypnotic effect. In two patients, arterial blood concentrations of propofol were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),, compared with those of the estimated blood concentrations. Until resection of the tumor, propofol was infused at a rate of 10 mg x kg x hr. After resection of the tumor, propofol dosage was reduced to 3-6 mg x kg x hr, keeping the BIS values around 60. Rapid infusion of fluid, norepinephrine was required to maintain blood pressure after removal of the tumor in two patients. In one patient, blood pressure was maintained well without rapid infusion of fluid or vasopressor. Arterial blood concentration of propofol after resection of the tumor was equal to the estimated blood concentration (3.04 vs 3.02 microg x ml) in a patient without rapid infusion of fluid. In a patient with rapid infusion of fluid, the arterial blood concentration was lower than the estimated blood concentration (2.59 vs 3.58 microg x ml). The anesthetic depth can not be estimated accurately by hemodynamic changes in the patients undergoing pheochromocytoma resection. BIS monitoring should be recommended for adjustment of propofol dosage after pheochromocytoma resection.Atherosclerosis is a long-term chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased concentrations of inflammatory hepatic markers, such as CRP and fibrinogen, and of peripheral origin, such as. Effective coronary artery disease (CAD) prevention requires the use of agents that act beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering. appear to comprehensively address some of the most common clinical phenotypes of the high CAD risk patient of the 21st century such as in the syndrome and type 2 diabetes: low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high triglycerides, small, dense low-density lipoprotein, and a proinflammatory, procoagulant state.General versus spinal anesthesia with different forms of sedation in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy: results of a prospective, randomized study. To assess the impact of spinal anesthesia (SpA) combined with three different forms of conscious sedation on intraoperative, postoperative outcome in patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for organ confined prostate cancer (pCa). A total of 121 consecutive patients with pCa undergoing RRP were randomized into four groups. They were randomized as follows: group 1 (general anesthesia: 34 patients), group 2 (lumbar 2 to lumbar 3 interspace SpA with diazepam as sedative agent: 28), group 3 (SpA with propofol: 30),, group 4 (SpA with midazolam: 29). Intraoperative, perioperative parameters were collected. The present study showed that muscle relaxation throughout RRP was not different in the four groups bleeding was significantly (P = 0.04) lower with SpA, regardless of the form of sedation. Group 3 patients reported the best postoperative oxygen saturation percentage by pulse oximetry, sedation score (P = 0.02 d.f. = 3, P < 0.0001 d.f. = 3, respectively), the shortest waiting time in the postoperative holding area (P < 0.001 d.f. = 3), the lowest pain on postoperative day 1 (P = 0.0004 d.f. = 3),, the highest frequency of first flatus passage (P = 0.0001 d.f. = 3). A higher number of group 4 patients were able to carry out unassisted ambulation (P < 0.0001 d.f. = 3). Conscious sedation coupled with SpA is a safe, reliable, effective procedure for patients undergoing RRP. The use of propofol as sedative agent offers several advantages both over other types of conscious sedation, general anesthesia.The consumption of fruits, vegetables,, whole grains rich in antioxidative phytochemicals is associated with a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cataract,, aged-related functional decline. For example, phenolic acids are among the main antioxidative phytochemicals in grains that have been shown to be beneficial to human health. Corn (Zea mays L.) is a major staple food in several parts of the world thus, the antioxidant activity of several corn types was evaluated. The 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl free radical (DPPH*) scavenging activity, total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity of lipid-soluble substances (ACL), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC),, phenolic acid compositions of typical, mutant genotypes (typical-1, waxy, typical-2,, high-amylose) were investigated. The DPPH* scavenging activity at 60 min was 34.39-44.51% in methanol extracts, 60.41-67.26% in HCl methanol (1 99, v v) extracts of corn. The DPPH* scavenging activity of alkaline hydrolysates of corn ranged from 48.63 to 64.85%. The TPC ranged from 0.67 to 1.02 g, from 0.91 to 2.15 g of ferulic acid equiv kg of corn in methanol, HCl methanol extracts, respectively. The TPC of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 2.74 to 6.27 g of ferulic acid equiv kg of corn. The ACL values were 0.41-0.80, 0.84-1.59 g of Trolox equiv kg of corn in methanol, HCl methanol extracts, respectively. The ORAC values were 10.57-12.47, 18.76-24.92 g of Trolox equiv kg of corn in methanol, HCl methanol extracts, respectively. ORAC values of alkaline hydrolysates ranged from 42.85 to 68.31 g of Trolox equiv kg of corn. The composition of phenolic acids in alkaline hydrolysates of corn was p-hydroxybenzoic acid (5.08-10.6 mg kg), vanillic acid (3.25-14.71 mg kg), caffeic acid (2.32-25.73 mg kg), syringic acid (12.37-24.48 mg kg), p-coumaric acid (97.87-211.03 mg kg), ferulic acid (1552.48-2969.10 mg kg),, o-coumaric acid (126.53-575.87 mg kg). Levels of DPPH* scavenging activity, TPC, ACL,, ORAC in HCl methanol extracts were obviously higher than those present in methanol extracts. There was no significant loss of antioxidant capacity when corn was dried at relatively high temperatures (65, 93 degrees C) postharvest as compared to drying at ambient temperatures (27 degrees C). Alkaline hydrolysates showed very high TPC, ACL,, ORAC values when compared to methanol, HCl methanol extracts. High-amylose corn had a better antioxidant capacity than did typical (nonmutant) corn genotypes.Routine aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the primary prevention of colorectal cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement. This statement summarizes the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation, supporting scientific evidence on routine use of aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the primary prevention of colorectal cancer. The complete information on which this statement is based, including evidence tables, references, is available in the accompanying articles in this issue, on the USPSTF Web site (http: www.preventiveservices.ahrq.gov). The USPSTF is redesigning its recommendation statement in response to feedback from primary care clinicians. The USPSTF plans to release, later in 2007, a new, updated recommendation statement that is easier to read, incorporates advances in USPSTF methodology. The recommendation statement below is an interim version that combines existing language, elements with a new format. Although the definitions of grades remain the same, other elements have been revised.Secondary chemoprevention of Barrett's esophagus with celecoxib: results of a randomized trial. Barrett's esophagus is a premalignant condition that is a risk factor for the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma, a disease whose incidence is rapidly increasing. Because aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as celecoxib, may decrease the risk of developing esophageal cancer, we investigated the effect of long-term administration of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus with dysplasia. Chemoprevention for Barrett's Esophagus Trial (CBET) is a phase IIb multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial of celecoxib in patients with Barrett's esophagus, low- or high-grade dysplasia. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 200 mg of celecoxib or placebo, both administered orally twice daily,, then stratified by grade of dysplasia. The primary outcome was the change from baseline to 48 weeks of treatment in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia between the celecoxib, placebo arms. Secondary, tertiary outcomes included evaluation of changes in histology, expression levels of relevant biomarkers. All statistical tests were two-sided. From April 1, 2000, through June 30, 2003, 222 patients were registered into CBET,, 100 of them with low- or high-grade Barrett's dysplasia were randomly assigned to treatment (49 to celecoxib, 51 to placebo). After 48 weeks of treatment, no difference was observed in the median change in the proportion of biopsy samples with dysplasia or cancer between treatment groups in either the low-grade (median change with celecoxib = -0.09, interquartile range IQR = -0.32 to 0.14, with placebo = -0.07, IQR = -0.26 to 0.12 P = .64) or high-grade (median change with celecoxib = 0.12, IQR = -0.31 to 0.55,, with placebo = 0.02, IQR = -0.24 to 0.28 P = .88) stratum. No statistically significant differences in total surface area of the Barrett's esophagus in prostaglandin levels. Administration of 200 mg of celecoxib twice daily for 48 weeks of treatment does not appear to prevent progression of Barrett's dysplasia to cancer.Mechanism of proteoglycan aggregate degradation in cartilage stimulated with oncostatin M. To investigate the potential synergistic, differential effects of cytokine combinations on proteoglycan aggregate catabolism in cartilage. Bovine articular cartilage explants were maintained in organ culture, subjected to stimulation with cytokine combinations. Aggrecan, link protein, hyaluronan (HA) release, degradation were analyzed,, the effect of the hyaluronidase inhibitor apigenin was investigated. For all cytokine mixtures studied cleavage of aggrecan only by aggrecanase action was apparent. This was abolished by the hyaluronidase inhibitor, apigenin. In addition, in the presence of OSM a low molecular weight aggrecan G3 product was observed. Under cytokine stimulation, aggrecan release from cartilage may take place via proteolysis of the aggrecan core protein or via depolymerization of HA, with the latter being induced by OSM. OSM is associated with joint inflammation, its participation may account for the more rapid loss of aggrecan from articular cartilage in the inflammatory arthritides, compared to osteoarthritis.Colorectal cancer risk, chronic illnesses, operations, medications: case control results from the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. 1988. The associations between colorectal cancer risk, several chronic illnesses, operations, various medications were examined in 715 colorectal cancer cases, 727 age-, sex-matched controls in data derived from a large, comprehensive population-based study of this cancer conducted in Melbourne, Australia. There was a statistically significant deficit among cases of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, chronic chest disease, chronic arthritis, a statistically significant excess of 'haemorrhoids' among cases,, all of these differences were consistent for both colon cancer , rectal cancers, for both males, females. Although no statistically significant differences were found for other cancers, there were twice as many breast cancers among cases (16) than among controls (8), also there were 9 uterine cancers among cases, only 2 among controls. There was a statistically significant deficit among cases in the use of aspirin-containing medication, vitamin supplements, this was consistent for both colon cancer , rectal cancers, for both males, females. There was a statistically significant excess of large bowel polypectomy among cases. The modelling of these significant associations simultaneously in a logistic regression equation indicated that hypertension, heart disease, chronic arthritis, aspirin use were each independent effects, consistent for both colon cancer , rectal cancers for both males, females, also that these effects were independent of dietary risk factors previously described in the Melbourne study. Lung cancer, regular use of aspirin, nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US. There is evidence of a reduced risk of some cancer sites associated with use of aspirin (ASA), nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NANSAIDs). Our objective was to examine the association of regular use of ASA, NANSAIDs with lung cancer. A hospital-based case-control study of 1884 incident cases of lung cancer, 6251 controls with noncancer diagnoses. Use of ASA, NANSAIDs was considered 'regular' if it occurred on > or =4 days week, lasted for > or =3 months. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds_ratio (OR), 95% confidence intervals. The OR for regular use of ASA was 1.1 (0.9-1.4),, the corresponding estimate for regular NANSAID use was 1.0 (0.7-1.3). There was no evidence of decreased risk within strata of age, sex, years of education, or interview year. Examining the association within strata of duration of use, recency of use, cigarette smoking status, pack-years of cigarette smoking, or histologic type of cancer produced no ORs significantly different from 1.0. The hypothesis that regular use of ASA or NANSAIDs reduces the risk of lung cancer is not supported by the present data.Patient preferences for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. Although evidence suggests that aspirin, celecoxib may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), these drugs can also cause harmful side effects. The aim of this study was to characterize patient preferences for celecoxib, aspirin. Participants completed a computer-based patient decision-making questionnaire that included an educational component outlining the benefits, harms of celecoxib, aspirin. Under the base conditions 7.4% would take celecoxib, 43.6% would take aspirin males were more willing than females to take aspirin. Patients identified the increased risk of myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal events as the primary reasons for their unwillingness to take celecoxib, aspirin, respectively. A majority of subjects would not take either drug, after considering their benefits, harms, although participants were almost six times more likely to take aspirin than celecoxib. These data serve to inform physicians, researchers regarding the variability, factors that affect patient preferences for CRC chemoprevention.Do Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) Increase the Risk of Thyroid Cancer? An increased incidence of thyroid cancer has been reported in many parts of the world including the United States during the past several decades. Recently emerging evidence has demonstrated that polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (PHAHs), particularly polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), alter thyroid hormone homeostasis, cause thyroid dysfunction. However, few studies have been conducted to test whether exposure to PBDEs, other PHAHs increases the risk of thyroid cancer. Here, we hypothesize that elevated exposure to PHAHs, particularly PBDEs, increases the risk of thyroid cancer, may explain part of the increase in incidence of thyroid cancer during the past several decades. Such variation may result in different individual susceptibilities to PBDEs, other PHAHs, the subsequent development of thyroid cancer. The investigation of this hypothesis will lead to an improved understanding of the role of PBDEs, other PHAHs in thyroid tumorigenesis, may provide a real means to prevent this deadly disease.Monitoring, reducing exposure of infants to pollutants in house dust. The health risks to babies from pollutants in house dust may be 100 times greater than for adults. The young ingest more dust, are up to ten times more vulnerable to such exposures. House dust is the main exposure source for infants to allergens, lead,, PBDEs, as well as a major source of exposure to pesticides, PAHs, Gram-negative bacteria, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, phthalates, phenols,, other EDCs, mutagens,, carcinogens. Median or upper percentile concentrations in house dust of lead, several pesticides, PAHs may exceed health-based standards in North America. Early contact with pollutants among the very young is associated with higher rates of chronic illness such as asthma, loss of intelligence, ADHD,, cancer in children, adults. The potential of infants, who live in areas with soil contaminated by automotive, industrial emissions, can be given more protection by improved home cleaning, hand washing. Babies who live in houses built before 1978 have a prospective need for protection against lead exposures homes built before 1940 have even higher lead exposure risks. The concentration of pollutants in house dust may be 2-32 times higher than that found in the soil near a house. Reducing infant exposures, at this critical time in their development, may reduce lifetime health costs, improve early learning,, increase adult productivity. Some interventions show a very rapid payback. Two large studies provide evidence that home visits to reduce the exposure of children with poorly controlled asthma triggers may return more than 100% on investment in 1 yr in reduced health costs. The tools provided to families during home visits, designed to reduce dust exposures, included vacuum cleaners with dirt finders, HEPA filtration, allergy control bedding covers, high-quality door mats,, HEPA air filters. Infants receive their highest exposure to pollutants in dust at home, where they spend the most time,, where the family has the most mitigation control. Normal vacuum cleaning allows deep dust to build up in carpets where it can be brought to the surface, become airborne as a result of activity on the carpet. Vacuums with dirt finders allow families to use the three-spot test to monitor deep dust, which can reinforce good cleaning habits. Motivated families that receive home visits from trained outreach workers can monitor, reduce dust exposures by 90% or more in 1 wk. The cost of such visits is low considering the reduction of risks achieved. Improved home cleaning is one of the first results observed among families who receive home visits from MHEs, CHWs. We believe that proven intervention methods can reduce the exposure of infants to pollutants in house dust, while recognizing that much remains to be learned about improving the effectiveness of such methods.Effects of propofol induction on haemodynamics. Propofol is probably the most popular intravenous anaesthetic in daily practice. Its use is known to be associated with dose-dependent cardiovascular compromise. We have assessed the effect of a single dose of propofol on cardiovascular function. Eighty-six ASA I, II patients of both sexes, scheduled for elective thoracic cancer surgery, were enrolled to the study. Midazolam 7.5 mg was given as premedication. All patients received epidural or paravertebral catheters one day before the surgery,, a Swan-Ganz catheter before induction. MAP, CO, SVI, PAP, PCWP, SVRI, PVRI, LVSWI, RWSWI, CPP were measured before induction (I), after administration of 1 mg kg propofol with 1-3 microg kg fentanyl, during spontaneous respiration (II). Propofol increased: heart rate (8%), PAP (12%), PVRI (27%), PCWP (27%), decreased MAP (4.5%), CI (12%), SVI (18%), LVSWI (23%), RVSWI (17%). CPP decreased by 7%. SVRI remained unchanged. The results indicated that 1 mg kg propofol moderately compromised cardiac contractility, increased afterload on the right ventricle, without significant effect on coronary perfusion pressure. The cardiovascular compromise was clinically insignificant, but caution is required when propofol is administered in larger doses.Acute postischemic treatment with esr1 agonist or esr1-beta agonist improves myocardial recovery. After ischemia reperfusion (I R) injury, female hearts demonstrate improved functional recovery compared with male, which suggests a protective role for estrogen. Acute postischemic treatment with 17-beta-estradiol (E2) attenuates myocardial dysfunction. However, it is unknown by which esr1 (ER) E2 mediates this acute cardioprotection during I R. Therefore, we hypothesize that postischemic infusion of the selective ER-alpha agonist (4,4',4''- 4-propyl-(1H pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl tris-phenol PPT ) or the selective ER-beta agonist (2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl propionitrile DPN ) will improve myocardial function after I R injury. Isolated, perfused hearts (Langendorff) from adult male rats were subjected to 25 minutes of ischemia followed by 40 minutes of reperfusion. Hearts (n = 4-6 per group) were randomly infused with either perfusate, PPT or DPN at 1, 10, or 100 nmol L throughout reperfusion. After I R, heart tissue was analyzed for tnf (TNF alpha, interleukin (IL 1beta, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Postischemic treatment with 10 nmol L of PPT significantly improved myocardial function. Additionally, 10 or 100 nmol L of DPN significantly increased myocardial functional recovery after I R injury, with maximum benefit at the 10 nmol L dose. A trend toward lower levels of LDH was noted in DPN-, PPT-treated groups after I R injury. Neither PPT nor DPN affected myocardial production of TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. However, higher levels of myocardial VEGF were noted in the PPT-treated group compared with controls. Both ER-alpha, ER-beta are involved in mediating E2-induced rapid cardioprotection after I R injury. ER subtypes may benefit both males, females in response to myocardial ischemia.Mass balance for POPs in hazardous, municipal solid waste incinerators. The amount of different persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the input of waste incinerators was compared to that in the output. Three cases were considered: a rotary kiln incinerating hazardous waste, a grate furnace incinerating municipal solid waste (MSW), the same grate furnace co-incinerating plastics of waste of electrical, electronic equipment (WEEE), automotive shredder residue (ASR) with MSW. The mass balance for PCBs in the rotary kiln indicates that these POPs are destroyed effectively during incineration. The grate furnace can be a sink or source of PCDD Fs, PCBs depending on the concentrations in the incinerated waste. In order to compare the total amount of POPs in input, output, a methodology was developed whereby the amount of POPs was weighed according to minimal risk doses (MRDs) or cancer potency factors. For both incinerators the PCDD Fs, PCBs, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are the main contributors to total weighed POP output. In MSW, the PCDD Fs, PBDD Fs, polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs) are the main contributors to the weighed POP input. The ratios of the weighed POP-input over -output clearly indicate that the rotary kiln incinerating hazardous waste is a weighed POP sink. The grate furnace incinerating MSW is a weighed POP sink or source depending on the POP-concentrations in the waste, but the difference between output, input is rather limited. When e.g. ASR, plastics of WEEE, containing high concentrations of PBDEs, PCBs, are co-incinerated in the grate furnace, it is clearly a weighed POP sink. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be protective against cardiac complications following anthracycline chemotherapy. Doxorubicin (DOX), despite causing cardiac toxicity, is an anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent that plays an important role in the treatment of breast cancer. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) may protect against cardiac toxicity in patients receiving DOX chemotherapy. A total of 143 patients receiving DOX at the Masonic Comprehensive Cancer Clinic, University of Minnesota, who had two or more multigated blood pool imaging (MUGA) scans or echocardiograms performed between 2004, 2007 were identified, reviewed. Patients with a 10% absolute drop in their ejection fraction (EF) or more to below 55% were identified, compared with those that did not have a 10% decline in EF. Impact of patient variables, the use of concurrent medications on EF drop were evaluated using logistic regression. Median age was 52 years old. 85 (60%) were female. Cancer diagnosis was breast (n = 26), lymphoma (n = 92),, other (n = 25). In spite of a similar baseline EF in all the patients, 22 142 (15%) patients had a significant drop in EF during DOX chemotherapy. Adjusting for age, the odds_ratio of EF drop associated with the use of ACE-I is 0.267 (P = 0.0940), suggesting that ACE-I has a protective effect. Cumulative DOX dose, the use of beta-blockers, or aspirin did not appear to be predictive or protective. Although not statistically significant, this study suggests that the use of ACE-I when given with DOX chemotherapy protects against DOX chemotherapy, warrants further investigation.Increased risk of colon cancer associated with a genetic polymorphism of SMAD7. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified SMAD7 on 8q21 as being associated with colorectal cancer. We evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the SMAD7 gene, including rs4939827, rs12953717,, rs4464148, previously identified from GWAS in a large population-based case-control study of colon cancer. We observed that rs12953717 was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of colon cancer odds_ratio, 1.38 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.13-1.68 P linear trend < 0.01 for the TT genotype compared with the CC genotype, whereas the CC genotype of the rs4939827 SNP was inversely associated with colon cancer (0.77 95% CI, 0.64-0.93) relative to the TT genotype. There were no significant differences in association for either of these polymorphisms when stratified by age, tumor site, sex, or family history. The odds_ratio between SMAD7, colon cancer among individuals reporting recent aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.43-0.85) for the CC genotype of the rs4939827 polymorphism, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.20-2.38) for the TT genotype of the rs1295371 polymorphism. This result compares to odds_ratio of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68-1.09) for rs4939827, 1.22 (95% CI, 0.96-1.56) among individuals who did not use aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. No significant associations were observed for the rs4464148 SNP or other SNPs evaluated in the SMAD7. These results corroborate the findings of GWAS in colon cancer pointing to SMAD7, reinforce interest in SNPs in this gene.The relationship of cerb B 2 expression with esr1, progesterone receptor, prognostic parameters in endometrial carcinomas. Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses of ER, PR, c-erbB-2 were performed in 72 EC cases. We detected a positive staining with c erbB 2 in 18.1% of the cases, determined a statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2, PR. We could not find a statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2 staining, ER. There was not a statistically significant difference between c-erbB-2, histological grade. The highest level of c-erbB-2 was found in grade 2 cases. There was not any statistically significant relation between c-erbB-2, menstrual status, myometrial invasion, lymph node status, stage, survival. Although our study provides additional evidence of the potential prognostic role of c-erbB-2, further prospective, controlled studies are required to validate their clinical usefulness.Effects of electroacupuncture of different acupoint groups on sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing resection of supratentorial tumors. To observe the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) of different acupoint groups on the sevoflurane anesthetic requirement for resection of supratentorial tumors, the speed of post-operation recovery. A total of 120 cases of supratentorial tumor resection patients were randomly, equally allocated into general anesthesia (GA) group, EA-proximal acupoints group (EA-PA group), EA-distant acupoints group (EA-DA group). The supratentorial tumor patients were anesthetized with sevoflurane for surgery. Proximal acupoints used were Fengchi (GB 20), Tianzhu (BL 10), Cuanzhu (BL 2), Yuyao (EX-HN 4) that the formesr2 acupoints, the lattesr2 acupoints were for penetrative needling, distant acupoints used were Hegu (LI 4), Waiguan (TE 5), Jinmen (BL 63), Taichong (LR 3), Zusanli (ST 36), Qiuxu (GB 40) on the craniotomy side,, stimulated with EA (2 Hz 100 Hz, a tolerable electric stimulating strength), beginning from the anesthesia induction till the end of surgical operation. All patients were anesthetized by inhalation of propofol (2 mg kg), sufentanil (0.3 microg kg), vecuronium bromide (0.1 mg kg), maintained with sevoflurane. The end-tidal sevoflurane concentration, minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), bispectral index (BIS),, the speed of recovery were recorded. In comparison with the GA group, the end-tidal concentrations during anesthesia maintenance at the time-points of post skull drilling, dura incising, intracranial operation in EA-PA group, the time-points of post skull drilling, skull opening, dura incising,, intracranial operation in EA-DA group,, the MAC of sevoflurane at the time-points of skull drilling in EA-DA group,, skull opening, dura incising, intracranial operation, dura suturing in both EA-PA, EA-DA groups were significantly lower (P 0.05). EA of both proximal, distant acupoints can reduce the expired concentration, MAC of sevoflurane during anesthesia maintenance,, accelerate the recovery after cease of anesthesia in supratentorial tumor resection patients.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, risk of melanoma. We investigated the association between NSAIDs, melanoma to determine if there was epidemiologic evidence of a chemopreventive effect from these medications. Three hundred twenty-seven subjects with incident melanoma, 119√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°melanoma-free controls completed a structured interview assessing melanoma risk factors. The unadjusted odds_ratio (OR) for use of nonaspirin NSAIDs was 0.58 (95% CI 0.31-1.11), in a comparison of subjects with melanoma to controls. After adjustment for melanoma risk factors, the OR was 0.71 (95% CI 0.23-2.02). Aspirin users had an unadjusted OR of 0.85 (95% CI 0.45-1.69), an adjusted OR of 1.45 (95% CI 0.44-4.74). In this pilot study, we found no evidence of a significant association between analgesic use, melanoma risk when potential confounders are assessed. Based on conflicting reports in the literature, meta-analysis may be appropriate.Subchronic oral toxicity, cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies of resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol with cancer preventive activity. To characterize the subchronic oral toxicity of resveratrol, CD rats received daily gavage doses of 0, 200, 400, or 1000 mg resveratrol kg day,, beagle dogs received daily capsule doses of 0, 200, 600, or 1200 mg resveratrol kg day for 90 days. Resveratrol induced only minimal toxicity, consisting of dose-related reductions in body weight gain in female rats, both sexes of dogs,, a statistically significant increase in bilirubin levels in rats at the 1000 mg kg day dose. Clinical observations, hematology, ophthalmology, neurotoxicity evaluations (functional observational batteries), organ weights,, gross pathology provided no biologically significant evidence of resveratrol toxicity in either species. In rats, the high dose of resveratrol reduced the incidence of cardiomyopathy no other microscopic changes were seen. Histopathologic changes in dogs were limited to minimal inflammatory infiltrates in the kidney, urinary bladder, which were not considered toxicologically significant. A cardiovascular safety pharmacology (telemetry) study in dogs revealed no evidence of resveratrol toxicity. Based on body weight effects, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for resveratrol was 200mg kg day in rats, 600 mg kg day in dogs. The apparent cardioprotective activity of resveratrol in rats demonstrates that its potentially beneficial activities may extend beyond efficacy in cancer prevention.Evaluation of phytochemical composition, antioxidant capacity of a decoction containing Adenanthera pavonina L., Thespesia populnea L. A decoction prepared with barks of Adenanthera pavonina, Thespesia populnea is a herbal formulation which has been prescribed in Sri Lanka in the treatment of cancer patients for many years. This study was designed to investigate its phytochemical, antioxidant properties. The total phenolics, flavonoids were determined using Folin-Ciocalteau, aluminum chloride colorimetric methods, respectively. Gallic acid content in the decoction was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The antioxidant properties were evaluated by 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical assay, nitric oxide scavenging assay, deoxyribose method,, the reducing power of the decoction. The concentration of total phenols, flavonoids,, gallic acid of the decoction were  gallic acid equivalents,  of (- Epigallocatechin gallate equivalents,,  respectively. The EC50 for DPPH, nitric oxide scavenging,, deoxyribose assays were, respectively. Reducing power of the decoction increased with the concentration. These suggested that the decoction prepared with A. pavonina, T. populnea can be a nutraceuticals.Non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for the primary chemoprevention of non-gastrointestinal cancer: summary of evidence. There is evidence that aspirin is effective for the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. Due to their similar pharmacodynamics, the use of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been suggested for other cancer sites. Although this possibility has been discussed in the literature, uncertainty remains about the actual effects of NSAIDs other than aspirin in nongastrointestinal cancer. To summarize the best available evidence of the primary chemopreventive effects of non-aspirin NSAIDs for nongastrointestinal cancer. Our inclusion criteria were narrative or systematic reviews, clinical guidelines and, if they had not been previously included, primary controlled studies that evaluated the effectiveness of non-aspirin NSAIDs in preventing non-gastrointestinal cancer in healthy individuals. Studies were retrieved from the following databases: Guidelines.gov, BMJ Clinical Evidence, TRIP database, UpToDate, MEDLINE, CANCERLIT, Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science, Scopus. Two independent reviewers selected eligible studies. Data were extracted by one reviewer, crosschecked by two others. We found 9,984 non-duplicated articles, included 56 eligible studies. Most of these studies were observational. The studies reported conflicting results or no statistically significant associations between the use of non-aspirin NSAIDs, risk of lung, ovary, bladder, prostate, skin,, head, neck cancers. In contrast, an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma found to be statistically significant. The included studies had methodological limitations, which reduces our confidence in their results. We did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of the non-aspirin NSAIDs for the primary chemoprevention of a wide variety of non-gastrointestinal cancers. This scenario suggests caution when considering the routine use of non-aspirin NSAIDs. Additional well-conducted controlled studies may provide more conclusive evidence on this issue, but there are concerns about the risks of such exposure.Histogram analysis of whole-lesion enhancement in differentiating clear cell from papillary subtype of renal cell cancer. To compare histogram analysis of voxel-based whole-lesion (WL) enhancement to qualitative assessment, region-of-interest (ROI based enhancement analysis in discriminating the renal cell cancer (RCC) subtype clear cell RCC (ccRCC) from papillary RCC (pRCC). In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective study, 73 patients underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging prior to surgery for RCC between January 2007, January 2010. Three-dimensional fat-suppressed T1-weighted gradient-echo corticomedullary phase acquisitions, obtained before, after contrast agent administration, were transferred to a workstation at which automated registration followed by semiautomated segmentation of the RCC was performed. Percent enhancement was computed on a per-voxel basis: (SI(post) - SI(pre)) SI(pre) .100, where SI(pre), SI(post) indicate signal intensity before, after contrast enhancement, respectively. The WL quantitative parameters of mean, median,, third quartile enhancement, histogram distribution parameters kurtosis, skewness were computed for each lesion. WL enhancement parameters were compared with ROI-based analysis, qualitative assessment with regards to diagnostic accuracy, interreader agreement in differentiating ccRCC from pRCC. There were 19 pRCCs, 55 ccRCCs at pathologic examination. ccRCC had significantly higher WL mean, median,, third quartile enhancement compared with pRCC, hade significantly lower kurtosis, skewness (all P < .001). Third quartile enhancement had the highest accuracy (94.6% area under the curve, 0.980) in discriminating ccRCC from pRCC, which was significantly higher than the accuracy of qualitative assessment (86.0% P = .04) but not significantly higher than that of ROI enhancement (89.2% P = .52). WL enhancement parameters had higher interreader agreement (k = 0.91-1.0) compared with ROI enhancement or qualitative assessment (k = 0.83, 0.7, respectively) in discriminating ccRCC from pRCC. WL enhancement histogram analysis is feasible, can potentially be used to differentiate ccRCC from pRCC tapentadol ER for managing moderate to severe chronic pain. Chronic non-cancer-related pain affects a large proportion of the adult population, is often difficult to manage effectively. Although opioid analgesics have been used to relieve chronic pain of different etiologies, opioids are associated with a range of side effects that may reduce patient quality of life, lead to reduced compliance with treatment.Tapentadol is a centrally acting analgesic with 2 mechanisms of action, √å?√•?-opioid receptor agonism, norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, that is available in an extended-release formulation for the management of chronic pain. To review the efficacy of tapentadol extended release (ER) for the management of moderate to severe chronic nociceptive, neuropathic pain. Efficacy results are summarized for four 15-week phase 3 studies of tapentadol ER in patients with moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis knee pain (2 studies ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers: NCT00421928, NCT00486811), low back pain (NCT00449176),, pain related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN NCT00455520) a one-year phase 3 study of tapentadol ER in patients with moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis pain or low back pain (NCT00361504), a pooled analysis of data from the 15-week studies in patients with osteoarthritis knee pain or low back pain. A summary of the comparative tolerability for tapentadol ER, the active comparator used in these studies, oxycodone controlled release (CR), is provided. of these studies showed that tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) was effective for the management of moderate to severe chronic osteoarthritis knee pain, low back pain,, pain related to DPN. Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) has been shown to provide comparable pain relief to oxycodone HCl CR (20 - 50 mg bid) for chronic osteoarthritis knee pain, low back pain over up to one year of treatment. Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) was associated with an improved tolerability profile, particularly gastrointestinal tolerability profile,, with lower rates of treatment discontinuations, adverse event-related discontinuations compared with oxycodone HCl CR (50 - 250 mg bid) over up to one year of treatment in patients with osteoarthritis knee pain, low back pain. Differences in the design, duration of these phase 3 studies may limit comparisons of the efficacy results nevertheless, this demonstrates the broad of tapentadol ER for different types of nociceptive, neuropathic pain. Tapentadol ER (100 - 250 mg bid) is moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain, low back pain,, pain related to DPN, provides efficacy similar to that of oxycodone HCl CR (20 - 50 mg bid) for patients with osteoarthritis, low back pain. Tapentadol ER treatment has been associated with better gastrointestinal tolerability, compliance with therapy than oxycodone CR, which suggests that tapentadol ER may be a better option for the long-term management of chronic pain.The effect of fibrin clot inhibitors on the immunomodulatory efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Gu√å√Ñ√•¬©rin therapy for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. To determine if there is a difference in clinical outcomes among non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients taking fibrin clot-inhibiting (FCI) medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin) while receiving Bacillus Calmette-Gu√å√Ñ√•¬©rin (BCG) therapy compared with their counterparts not taking anticoagulation. Our Investigational Review Board-approved database was queried for patients who received an induction course of BCG from 2001 to 2011. The analysis included 224 patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up. Recurrence-free survival (RFS), cystectomy-free survival, overall survival,, disease-specific survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method stratified by FCI status. Logistic regression was used to predict the initial response rate to BCG, progression by FCI status. Of the 224 patients analyzed, 68, 19,, 23 patients were taking aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, respectively, at BCG induction. No specific FCI was associated with differences in cystectomy-free survival, overall survival, disease-specific survival, or the likelihood of progression at recurrence. Neither warfarin nor clopidogrel affected RFS. Patients taking aspirin trended toward increased RFS, although this was not statistically significant (P√å√¢ = .058). Contrary to the postulated inhibitory molecular effect of FCI on BCG-binding activity, this study did not substantiate a significant impact on BCG efficacy of the concomitant use of these medications during BCG induction. The observation that aspirin use potentiates an increased initial response to√å√¢ BCG may warrant further analysisHighly exfoliated sulfonated graphene sheets (SGSs), an alternative to graphene oxide, graphene derivatives, were synthesized, characterized. These particles were found to be non-toxic across the concentration range of 0.1 to 10 √å?√•?g ml. Internalization of SGSs was also studied by means of optical, electron microscopy. Although not conclusive, high-resolution transmission, scanning electron microscopy revealed variant internalization behaviors where some of the SGS became folded, compartmentalized into tight bundles within cellular organelles. The ability for cancer should be further investigated.Is aspirin useful in primary prevention? There is no evidence that aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, although it may change the way that they present. Indeed, there is no evidence that long-term aspirin should be given to patients even with known cardiovascular disease. Theoretical arguments that aspirin can prevent cardiovascular events by reducing the propagation of thrombus are countered by evidence that plaque haemorrhage from vasa vasorum may also cause plaque growth, instability. There is evidence that aspirin causes serious bleeding into the brain, the gut. Aspirin may also detract from the benefits of drugs that have definite cardiovascular benefits, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Meta-analysis is prone to multiple biases in favour of aspirin, including publication bias, bias due to trial, endpoint selection, bias due to interpretation. Meta-analysis should not be relied on in preference to adequately powered clinical trials. Unfortunately, the benefits of aspirin, if they exist, may be so small that a very large study indeed would be required to demonstrate that its benefits outweigh its risks. The evidence that aspirin might reduce cancer is intriguing but relies on data from trials conducted many decades ago using a wide range of aspirin doses. There is no reliable evidence that aspirin used in the current fashionable doses of 50-100 mg day is of any benefit in any common clinical setting.Despite the rise of public awareness, the incidence rate among the white population has been rising constantly for several decades. Systematic improvement in knowledge about the biology of pigment cells. Substances found in everyday diet, such as genistein, apigenin, quercetin, resveratrol,, curcumin may also have potential chemopreventive qualities. However, studies examining these compounds have shown widely varying results. Early reports on the possible chemopreventive activity of statins, fibrates were not proved by the results of randomized clinical trials. Similarly, case-control studies examining the influence of NSAIDs on the risk of melanoma do not confirm the antitumor activity. Further clinical trials involving carefully selected target populations as well as the identification of specific biomarkers of prognostic, predictive value seem to be essential for the evaluation studied substances.This review summarizes the weight of evidence relevant to the hypothesized mode of action (MOA) for PPAR? activator-induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis and identifies gaps in our knowledge of this MOA. Chemical-specific and mechanistic data support concordance of temporal and dose-response relationships for the key events associated with many PPAR? activators including a phthalate ester plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and the drug gemfibrozil. While biologically plausible in humans, the hypothesized key events in the rodent MOA, for PPAR? activators, are unlikely to induce liver tumors in humans because of toxicodynamic and biological differences in responses. This conclusion is based on minimal or no effects observed on growth pathways, hepatocellular proliferation and liver tumors in humans and/or species (including hamsters, guinea pigs and cynomolgous monkeys) that are more appropriate human surrogates than mice and rats at overlapping dose levels. Overall, the panel concluded that significant quantitative differences in PPAR? activator-induced effects related to liver cancer formation exist between rodents and humans. On the basis of these quantitative differences, most of the workgroup felt that the rodent MOA is \"not relevant to humans\" with the remaining members concluding that the MOA is \"unlikely to be relevant to humans\". The two groups differed in their level of confidence based on perceived limitations of the quantitative and mechanistic knowledge of the species differences, which for some panel members strongly supports but cannot preclude the absence of effects under unlikely exposure scenarios.Statin , aspirin for prevention of hepatocellular carcinoma: what are the levels of evidence? Recent analyses of large cohorts suggest that statins or aspirin may reduce the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to their observational nature, these studies may have been flawed by confounding by indication or immortal time bias. Reviews of clinical trials conducted in the metabolic or cardiovascular domain showed no effect of statins on cancer of any type. More convincing evidence is needed to support the potential preventive effect of aspirin on HCC, but a clinical trial would be achievable in patients who are at high risk. Prostate cancer, the influence of dietary factors, supplements: a systematic review. Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer worldwide after lung cancer. There is increasing evidence that diet, lifestyle plays a crucial role in prostate cancer biology, tumorigenesis. Prostate cancer itself represents a good model of cancer in which to look for chemopreventive agents due to the high disease prevalence, slowly progressive nature,, long latency period. Dietary agents have gained considerable attention, often receiving much publicity in the media. To review the key evidence available for potential chemopreventive nutrients. The methodology for this review involved a PubMed search from 1990 to 2013 using the key-words diet, prostate cancer, nutrition, prostate cancer, dietary factors, prostate cancer, prostate cancer epidemiology, prostate cancer prevention, prostate cancer progression. Red meat, dietary fat, milk intake should be minimised as they appear to increase the risk of prostate cancer. Fruit, vegetables, polyphenols may be preventive in prostate cancer, but further studies are needed to draw more solid conclusions, to clarify their role in patients with an established diagnosis of prostate cancer. Selenium, vitamin supplements cannot be advocated for the prevention of prostate cancer, indeed higher doses may be associated with a worse prognosis. There is no specific evidence regarding benefits of probiotics or prebiotics in prostate cancer. From the wealth of evidence available, many recommendations can be made although more randomised control trials are required. These need to be carefully designed due to the many confounding factors, heterogeneity of the population.Separation of two major chalcones from Angelica keiskei by high-speed counter-current chromatography. Angelica keiskei (Shin-sun cho) is an edible higher plant with the beneficial preventive effects on cancer, hypertension,, coronary heart disease. Two bioactive chalcones of Shin-sun cho, xanthoangelol (1), 4-hydroxyderricin (2), were separated simultaneously by using high-speed counter-current chromatography with a two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane-EtOAc-MeOH-H2O (9:5:9:4). Only nonconsuming processes, solvent fractionations, Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, were conducted as presteps. Xanthoangelol (1, 35.9 mg, 99.9 % purity at 254, 365 nm), 4-hydroxyderricin (2, 4.4 mg, 98.7 % purity at 254 nm, 98.8 % purity at 365 nm) were successfully purified from 70 mg of the processed extract from A. keiskei. The structures of two compounds were confirmed by (1)H-, (13)C-NMR analysis. Effects of stellate ganglionic block on hemodynamic changes, intrapulmonary shunt in perioperative patients with esophageal cancer. The aim of this study√å√¢ was to observe the effects of stellate ganglion block (SGB) on hemodynamic changes, intrapulmonary shunt during one-lung ventilation (OLV). Thirty ASA class I-II patients undergoing elective esophageal surgery were randomly divided into two groups: general anesthesia group (group N, n=15), general anesthesia combined SGB group (group S, n=15), patients in group S were received left SGB before induction. Radial artery was cannulated for arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring, blood sampling, Swan-Ganz catheter was position in the pulmonary artery via right internal jugular vein under local anesthesia. ECG, MAP, HR, CVP, continuous cardiac output (CCO) index, BIS were continuously monitored during anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with propofol 1.5-2.0 mg kg, sufentanil 0.4 √å?√•?g kg,, Rocuronium 0.6-0.9 mg kg. Endobronchial occluder was placed blindly after tracheal indubation, the correct position was verified by auscultation, fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The patients were mechanically ventilated. The ventilation conditions were Fio2=100%, VT = 8-10 ml kg, I: E = 1:2, respiratory rate was adjusted to maintained PETCO2 at 35-45 mmHg during both two-lung ventilation (TLV), OLV. Anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of propofol 4-10 mg kg√å√¢√•√°h, sufentanil 0.2 √å?√•?g kg√å√¢√•√°h, vecuronium o.1 mg kg√å√¢√•√°h, BIS was maintained at 45-55. Blood samples were taken from radial artery, S-G catheter for blood gas analysis at following intervals: during spontaneous breathing when the patient was awake (T0), 1 min after tracheal indubation (T1), 1 min after patient was placed in lateral position (T2), 15 min after it (T3), 1 min after ribs was braced (T4), 30, 60, 120 min during the course of OLV (T5, T6, T7), the two lungs were ventilated again for 30 min (T8), Qs Qt was calculated. SVRI, MAP, HR in group N increased significantly at T1, T2, T4 compared with group S (p < 0.05). Qs Qt was significantly increased after patient was placed in lateral position, increased further during OLV the calculated Qs Qt values were highest at T5√å√¢√•√° PaO2 was significantly lower after OLV was started, reached the lowest level at T6 then was gradually increasing. There was no significant difference in Qs Qt, PaO2 at all time points between two groups. SGB before induction effectively suppress the stress response work as stable blood dynamics, does not affect Qs Qt, arterial oxygenation during OLV, SGB is a safe technique of anesthesia for general thoracic surgery.Mediterranean diet, dietary polyphenols, low grade inflammation: results from the MOLI-SANI study. Low grade inflammation is characterized by raised concentrations of inflammatory markers in the absence of any overt symptoms, is recognized as a risk factor for a number of chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies suggest that low grade inflammation is mitigated by health promoting behaviours such as healthy eating patterns, physical activity, body weight maintenance, tobacco cessation. To date, large scale studies were mainly focused on circulating markers, little evidence is available on cellular biomarkers. The MOLI-SANI study is a prospective cohort study that has recruited  men, women aged years from the general population of the Molise Region, a Southern Italian area, with the purpose of investigating genetic, environmental risk protection factors for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular disease, cancer. Within this cohort, a composite score of low grade inflammation based on the use of plasmatic (C-reactive protein), cellular (leukocyte, platelet counts, granulocyte lymphocyte ratio) biomarkers has been proposed, validated. This score accounts for all possible effects of such inflammatory markers, thus overcoming any potential bias linked to the multi-collinearity of these variables. Of notice, the MOLI-SANI study was the first to address the relationship between the traditional Mediterranean diet, platelet, leucocyte counts as emerging cellular biomarkers of low grade inflammation. The present review paper will discuss the main findings derived from the MOLI-SANI study on the association of low grade inflammation with a Mediterranean eating pattern, with a particular emphasis on the associated dietary polyphenols.Effect of statin, aspirin use on toxicity, pathological complete response rate of neo-adjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer. To retrospectively evaluate the potential impact of statin, aspirin use on acute toxicity, pathological complete response (pCR) rate in rectal cancer patients receiving neo-adjuvant long-course radiation therapy (LCRT) with concurrent chemotherapy. A retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing neo-adjuvant LCRT for rectal adenocarcinoma at the Regional Cancer Treatment Service between 1 Septembesr2007, 1 June 2011. Data obtained include demographic details date, radiological TNM stage at diagnosis medication taken at time of RT toxicity during LCRT, surgical histology to determine if a pCR was obtained following LCRT. Neo-adjuvant LCRT was administered to 142 patients for rectal cancer during this period concurrent chemotherapy was omitted in 13 due to significant comorbidities. TNM stage was 2 or 3 radiologically at diagnosis in 127 (89.4%) of patients. At the time of LCRT, 23% were taking a statin, 25% were taking aspirin. Of 135 assessable patients, 34 (13%) achieved a pCR at surgery. On logistic regression, pCR was not significantly associated with the use of chemotherapy, statins, aspirin, other NSAIDs, T-stage or N-stage. There was no significant correlation between statin or aspirin use with bladder or rectal toxicity. Actuarial time to maximum rectal toxicity was not different in statin users or nonusers. In contrast to other larger retrospective series, this study did not find improvements in toxicity or pCR rate through statin or aspirin use in rectal cancer patients undergoing LCRT. Their potential benefits in this setting would be best studied prospectively in a large randomized trial. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating neurodegenerative disease, representing a major cause of neurological disability in young adults. The present study may be the first to indicate a pro-remyelinative effect for resveratrol which might represent a potential additive benefit in treating Multiple sclerosis.pro-inflammatory cytokine production of senior horses in vitro. Senior horses exhibit increased chronic, low-grade inflammation systemically, termed inflamm-aging. Inflammation is associated with many afflictions common to the horse, including laminitis, osteoarthritis, which are commonly treated with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) flunixin meglumine, phenylbutazone. long-term treatment with NSAIDs can result in negative side effects. Thus, bioactive polyphenols including curcuminoids, resveratrol, quercetin, pterostilbene,, hydroxypterostilbene were investigated. Heparinized blood was collected via jugular venipuncture from senior horses  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated using a Ficoll density gradient. PBMC were then incubated with multiple concentrations of all five polyphenols (curcuminoids, resveratrol, quercetin, pterostilbene,, hydroxypterostilbene), dissolved in DMSO to achieve the aforementioned concentrations. PBMC were stimulated the last 4h of the incubation period with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) ionomycin, Brefeldin A (BFA). PBMC were stained intracellularly for analyzed via flow cytometry. Data was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Viability of PBMC incubated with various compound concentrations were compared with PBMC incubated with DMSO alone (positive control). The highest concentration at which cell viability did not significantly differ from the positive control was. The highest concentration at which viability did not significantly differ from the positive control was. Polyphenols performed similarly to or more effectively than common NSAIDs in reducing lymphocyte production of inflammatory cytokines of the senior horse in vitro.  treatments for chronic inflammation in the horse.Updated evidence on endoscopic resection of early cancer from Japan. Endoscopic resection for early cancer (EGC) plays a central role in the treatment of EGC in Japan. However, there is still room for improvement,, it is necessary to summarize the recently obtained knowledge from Japan for further improvement. We conducted a PubMed search to select relevant articles in the 5√å√¢ years until Septembesr18, 2016, using the keywords cancer, endoscopic treatment, endoscopic submucosal dissection, endoscopic mucosal resection, or polypectomy, filtering article types as clinical study or clinical trial. Among the 329 articles selected automatically from the keywords polypectomy (1 article), endoscopic mucosal resection (29 articles), endoscopic submucosal dissection (77 articles),, endoscopic treatment (222 articles) in combination with cancer, 32 relevant articles from Japanese investigators were chosen. Seven articles were categorized into equipment, 4 into preparation, sedation, 17 into complications, their prevention,, 4 into therapeutic outcomes. Among them, CO2 insufflation, propofol sedation,, how to prevent post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) ulcer bleeding, achieve post-ESD ulcer healing were intensively investigated. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic mucosal resection, ESD were also reported as favorable outcomes. Endoscopic resection for EGC is still developing toward an ideal form, pursuing a more reliable, safer,, faster minimally invasive treatment.Positional variation of applicators during low dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy for cervical cancer: a prospective study. In order to know the effect of variation in position of applicators to the dose received by the tumor volume, critical organs such as rectum, bladder, the correlation of variation on the clinical outcome. 36 patients with histologically proven cervical cancer, undergoing intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) from Octobesr2005 to Decembesr2006 were the subjects of the study. Two pairs of orthogonal X-ray films were taken: one prior to loading of sources, the other after removal of sources. These patients were followed up as per the RTOG criteria. The median duration of insertion was 25 hours with a median follow up period of 6.7 months. The translational variation of the applicator position for all patients was 3 mm, 1 mm (2 SD), respectively, in the patient's lateral, antero-posterior direction. The rotational variation was 3, 4 degrees (2 SD) in the patient's transverse, sagittal planes. Detailed analysis of source movement showed following changes in median dose: point A: 14%, point B: 2%, point P: 1%, Rectum 1: 3.5%, Rectum 2: 4%, Bladder: 9.1%. The incidence of rectal toxicity was 6 36 (16.7%), that of bladder was 1 36 (2.8%). When the variables were grouped to evaluate the relationship: R2, rectal toxicity (p value: 0.002), point A, rectal toxicity (Pearson: 0.792), lateral displacement anteroposterior displacement, rectal toxicity (p value: 0.012 0.003), beta angle, R2 (p value: 0.002). The geometric relationships between the ICBT applicators, the critical structures vary during the course of low dose rate brachytherapy. Source movement does result in significant dose alterations in terms of increased rate of complications, but its impact on cure rates needs to be studied in the future.Polyphenol-Inspired Facile Construction of Smart Assemblies for ATP-, pH-Responsive Tumor MR Optical Imaging, Photothermal Therapy. Smart assemblies have attracted increased interest in various areas, especially in developing novel stimuli-responsive theranostics. Herein, commercially available, natural tannic acid (TA), iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3 O4 NPs) are utilized as models to construct smart magnetic assemblies based on polyphenol-inspired NPs-phenolic self-assembly between NPs, TA. Interestingly, the magnetic assemblies can be specially disassembled by adenosine triphosphate, which shows a stronger affinity to Fe3 O4 NPs than that of TA, partly replaces the surface coordinated TA. The disassembly can further be facilitated by the acidic environment hence causing the remarkable change of the transverse relaxivity, potent turn-on of fluorescence (FL) signals. Therefore, the assemblies for specific, sensitive tumor magnetic resonance, FL dual-modal imaging, photothermal therapy after intravenous injection of the assemblies are successfully employed. This work not only provides understandings on the self-assembly between NPs, polyphenols, but also will open new insights for facilely constructing versatile assemblies, extending their biomedical applications. novel polymorphisms in TMEM39A gene with systemic lupus erythematosus in a Chinese Han population. This study aimed to assess the association between 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes (IRF8, TMEM39A, IKZF3, ORMDL3, GSDMB,, ZPBP2), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Chinese Han population sample. We carried out a case-control study of 415 patients with SLE, 470 healthy controls without autoimmune disease or cancer. DNA for genetic analysis was isolated from the blood of all subjects using standard phenol-chloroform method. TagSNPs were identified using genotype data from the panel (Han Chinese in Beijing) of the HapMap Project, were selected using the Haploview program. Genotyping assay was conducted using the Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX Gold platform. The frequencies of the alleles, genotypes were calculated, analyzed.  Studies, haplotype analysis were also performed. The genotypic frequencies of rs12493175, rs13062955 were significantly different between the SLE patients, the healthy controls. Compared with the common homozygous genotype, the CT, genotypes in rs12493175, the AC,  genotypes in rs13062955 was observed to significantly reduce the risk of SLE. Our findings identified  in SNPs located in the TMEM39A gene associated with SLE susceptibility in a Chinese Han population.TPMT, COMT, ACYP2 genetic variants in paediatric cancer patients with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Cisplatin ototoxicity affects 42-88% of treated children. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), AYCP2 genetic variants have been associated with ototoxicity, but the findings have been contradictory. The aims of the study were as follows: (a) to investigate these associations in a carefully phenotyped cohort of UK children, (b) to perform a systematic review, meta-analysis. We recruited 149 children from seven UK centres using a retrospective cohort study design. All participants were clinically phenotyped carefully. Genotyping was performed for one ACYP2 (rs1872328), three TPMT (rs12201199, rs1142345, rs1800460), two COMT (rs4646316, rs9332377) variants. For CTCAE grading, hearing loss was present in 91 120 (75.8% worst ear), 79 120 (65.8% better ear). Using Chang grading, hearing loss was diagnosed in 85 119 (71.4% worst ear) versus 75 119 (63.0% better ear). No TPMT or COMT single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with ototoxicity. ACYP2 SNP rs1872328 was associated with ototoxicity (P=0.027 worst ear). Meta-analysis of our data with that reported in previous studies showed the pooled odds_ratio (OR) to be statistically significant for both the COMT SNP rs4646316 (OR: 1.50 95% confidence interval: 1.15-1.95), the ACYP2 SNP rs1872328 (OR: 5.91 95% confidence interval: 1.51-23.16). We showed an association between the ACYP2 polymorphism, cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, but not with the TPMT, COMT. A meta-analysis was statistically significant for both the COMT rs4646316, the ACYP2 rs1872328 SNPs. Grading the hearing of children with asymmetric hearing loss requires additional clarification.EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE HYDRO-ETHANOLIC ROOT EXTRACT OF ZANTHOXYLUM ZANTHOXYLOIDES ON HEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AND OXIDATIVE STRESS IN CYCLOPHOSPAMIDE TREATED RATS.  Animals were divided into 6 groups of 6 rats each, were pretreated oral doses of 75, 150, 225 mg kg of the extract for 7 days, then co-administered with 2.5 mg kg cyclophosphamide for 28 days. The LD50 of the extract was found to be 1682.3 mg kg. In the anti-oxidant enzyme assay, CAT was significantly (p < 0.05) increased for animals treated with 150 mg kg CP compared to 75 mg kg CP, 225 mg kg CP. GPx was significantly (p < 0.01) increased in rats treated with 75 mg kg CP compared to 150 mg kg CP, control. SOD was significantly (p < 0.01) increased in rats treated with 75 mg kg CP compared to the control. WBC was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced for 225 mg kg, 225 mg kg CP (p < 0.001), 150 mg kg CP (p < 0.001), 75 mg kg CP (p < 0.001), CP administered rats (p < 0.001) respectively compared to the control. LDL, CHOL were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) for rats treated with 75 mg kg CP, 225 mg kg CP, 225 mg kg. Phenol Concentrations During Childhood, Subsequent Measures of Adiposity Among Young Girls. Phenolic compounds represent a class of environmental chemicals with potentially endocrine-disrupting capabilities. We investigated longitudinal associations between childhood exposure to phenols, from both manmade, natural sources,, subsequent measures of adiposity among girls enrolled in Cancer, the Research Program between 2004, 2007. Baseline (ages 6-8 years) urinary concentrations were obtained for creatinine, phenol metabolites. Body mass index (weight (kg) height (m)2), waist circumference,, percent body fat were measured at annual or semiannual examinations through 2015 (n = 1,017). Linear mixed-effects regression was used to estimate how baseline concentrations of phenols (tertile groups) were related to changes in girls' adiposity measurements from ages 7 through 15 years. Enterolactone was inversely associated with body mass index, waist circumference,, percent body fat, while 2,5-dichlorophenol was positively associated with these measurements. A nonmonotonic association was observed for triclosan, girls' adiposity however, it was due to effect modification by baseline overweight status. Triclosan was positively associated with adiposity only among overweight girls. These results suggest that exposure to specific phenols during childhood may influence adiposity through adolescence.Primary Biliary Cholangitis: advances in management, treatment of the disease. Primary Biliary Cholangitis, previously known as Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, is a rare disease, which mainly affects women in their fifth to seventh decades of life. It is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by a progressive damage of interlobular bile ducts leading to ductopenia, chronic cholestasis, bile acids retention. Even if the disease usually presents a long asymptomatic phase, a slow progression, in many patients it may progress faster toward cirrhosis, its complications. The 10year mortality is greater than in diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus Hepatitis C Virus coinfection, breast cancer. Ursodeoxycholic acid is the only treatment available today, but even if effective in counteracting the disease progression for the majority of patients, in approximately 40% is not able to decrease effectively the alkaline phosphatase, a surrogate marker of disease activity. Recently, obeticholic acid received the European Medicines Agency conditional approval, as add on treatment in patients non responders or intolerant to ursodeoxycholic acid. The present paper illustrates the opinion of a working group, composed by clinical pharmacologists, gastroenterologists hepatologists with specific expertise on Primary Biliary Cholangitis, patient associations, on the state of the art, future perspectives of the disease management. The agreement on the document was reached through an Expert Meeting. Comparison of sedation between the endoscopy room, operation room during endoscopic submucosal dissection for neoplasms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The present study was performed to compare the safety of sedation during endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the endoscopy room versus operation room. In total, 297 patients with gastrointestinal tumors who underwent ESD from January 2011 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent ESD in the endoscopy room without propofol (Group E) versus operation room with propofol (Group O). The patient, tumor,, procedure characteristics adverse events, treatment outcomes were compared between the two groups. The patient, tumor characteristics, including age, comorbidities,, tumor size, histology, were not different between Groups E, O. The ESD procedure time was comparable between Groups E, O the anesthesia time was equivalent. There were no significant differences in adverse events between the two groups. During the ESD procedure, desaturation occurred significantly more often in Group E than O. The recovery time after ESD was significantly longer in Group E than O (180 (100-360) vs. 90 (0-180) min. A decreased desaturation rate, shorter recovery time after ESD were the advantages of sedation in the operation room with propofol compared with sedation in the endoscopy room. These findings warrant further exploration of the advantages of safe, effective ESD for upper gastrointestinal neoplasms in the operation room.Does the oncology community have a rejection bias when it comes to repurposed drugs? Among the various measures proposed to combat the challenge of financial toxicity in cancer care, an important strategy is the use of lower-priced drugs instead of expensive alternatives. However, the oncology community seems to either ignore or more readily reject cheaper drugs in cancer care compared to more expensive alternatives. In this commentary, we present three examples of lower-priced drugs rejected or ignored by the oncology community, contrast this with three expensive drugs where persistent optimism remained despite negative clinical trial results. We argue that all drugs be held to the same rigorous standards - this not only includes skepticism in the absence of sound evidence, but also the suspension of premature judgement as has happened in the cases of repurposed drugs.Inducers of Senescence, Toxic Compounds,, Senolytics: The Multiple Faces of Nrf2-Activating in Cancer Adjuvant Therapy. The reactivation of senescence in cancer, the subsequent clearance of senescent are suggested as intervention in the cancer. We herein describe in vitro, in vivo effects on cellular senescence. In light of available literature, it can be concluded that the meaning, the potential of adjuvant therapy with natural compounds in humans remain unclear, also taking into account the existence of few clinical trials mostly characterized by uncertain results. Further studies are needed to investigate the therapeutic potential of those compounds that display senolytic activity.Assessment of the Endocrine Disrupting Compounds on the Development of Vertebrate Neural Network Function Using Multi-electrode Arrays. Bis-phenols, such as bis-phenol A (BPA), bis-phenol-S (BPS), are polymerizing agents widely used in the production of plastics, numerous everyday products. They are classified as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDC) with estradiol-like properties. Long-term exposure to EDCs, even at low doses, has been linked with various health defects including cancer, behavioral disorders,, infertility, with greater vulnerability during early developmental periods. To study the effects of BPA on the development of neuronal function, we used an in vitro neuronal network derived from the early chick embryonic brain as a model.  There are several systems available in the market and, although there are variations in the number of electrodes, the type, quality of the electrode array, the analysis software, the basic underlying principles,, the data obtained is the same across the different systems. Although currently limited to analysis of two-dimensional in vitro cultures, these MEA systems are being improved to enable in vivo network activity in brain slices. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for embryonic exposure, recording neuronal network activity, synchrony, along with representative results.Dietary polyphenol intake, their major food sources in the Mexican Teachers' Cohort. Several descriptive studies on the intake of polyphenols, mostly flavonoids, have been published, especially in Europe, the USA, but insufficient data are still available in Latin-American countries, where different types of foods are consumed, different dietary habits are observed. The goal of this cross-sectional study was to estimate dietary intakes of polyphenols, including grand total, total per classes, subclasses, individual compounds,, to identify their main food sources in Mexican women. The Mexican Teachers' Cohort includes 115 315 female teachers, 25 years, older, from twelve states of Mexico, including urban, rural areas. Dietary data were collected in the period 2008-2011 using a validated FFQ,, individual polyphenol intake was estimated using food composition data from the Phenol-Explorer database. Median total polyphenol intake was the highest in Baja California (750 mg d), the lowest in Yucatan (536 mg d). The main polyphenols consumed were phenolic acids (56√å√¢√•√°3-68√å√¢√•√°5 % total polyphenols), followed by flavonoids (28√å√¢√•√°8-40√å√¢√•√°9 %). Intake of other polyphenol subclasses (stilbenes, lignans, others) was insignificant. Coffee, fruits were the most important food sources of phenolic acids, flavonoids, respectively. Intake of a total of 287 different individual polyphenols could be estimated, of which forty-two were consumed in an amount √å¬¢¬â√õ¬°√•¬¥1 mg d. The most largely consumed polyphenols were several caffeoylquinic acids (ranging from 20, 460 mg d), ferulic acid, hesperidin, proanthocyanidins. This study shows a large heterogeneity in intakes of individual polyphenols among Mexican women, but a moderate heterogeneity across Mexican states. Main food sources were also similar in the different states.Mucosa of human detrusor impairs contraction and beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation. To elucidate the impact of the mucosa on detrusor muscle function by investigating force of contraction under various stimulatory conditions and during subsequent relaxation using catecholamines. Detrusor tissue was obtained from patients who had undergone cystectomy for  cancer and strips of intact or mucosa-denuded muscle were set up for force measurement. Preparations were precontracted with KCl, carbachol or electric-field stimulation (EFS). Precontracted strips were relaxed using increasing concentrations of catecholamines in the absence and presence of the subtype-selective beta-adrenoceptor (AR) blockers CGP 20712A (beta1-ARs), ICI 118,551 (beta2-ARs), and L-748,337 (beta3-ARs). Force development in response to KCl (40√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°mM), carbachol (1√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å?√•?M) or EFS was larger in the absence of mucosa than in intact muscle strips. The force of contraction of mucosa-denuded strips with detached urothelium incubated in the same chamber was as low as in intact strips. Noradrenaline relaxed precontracted detrusor strips to a significantly larger extent and at lower concentrations in denuded than in intact strips. CGP 20712A did not affect noradrenaline-induced relaxation of denuded and intact strips, and ICI 118,551 did not influence noradrenaline-induced relaxation in denuded strips, but abolished the difference between denuded and intact strips. The antagonism of the relaxant effects of noradrenaline by L-748,337 was slightly smaller in intact than denuded strips. The mucosa of human detrusor strips impairs force development when stimulated with KCl, carbachol or EFS. The mucosa also blunts the relaxing effects of catecholamines. The latter effect does not involve the beta1-ARs but only of beta2-ARs, whereas beta3-ARs mediate the relaxation of human detrusor.  Disorders of innate immunity in human ageing and effects of nutraceutical administration. Immune decline with ageing accounts for the increased risk of infections, inflammatory chronic disease, autoimmunity and cancer in humans. Both innate and adaptive immune functions are compromised in aged people and, therefore, attempts to correct these dysfunctions represent a major goal of modern medicine. In this review, special emphasis will be placed on the aged innate immunity. As potential modifiers of the impaired innate immunity, some principal nutraceuticals will be illustrated, such as micronutrients, pre-probiotics and polyphenols. In elderly, clinical trials with the above products are scanty. SPOt: A novel and streamlined microarray platform for observing cellular tRNA levels. Recent studies have placed transfer RNA (tRNA), a housekeeping molecule, in the heart of fundamental cellular processes such as embryonic development and tumor progression. Such discoveries were contingent on the concomitant development of methods able to deliver high-quality tRNA profiles. The present study describes the proof of concept obtained in Escherichia coli (E. coli) for an original tRNA analysis platform named SPOt (Streamlined Platform for Observing tRNA). This approach comprises three steps. First, E. coli cultures are spiked with radioactive orthophosphate second, labeled total RNAs are trizol-extracted third, RNA samples are hybridized on in-house printed microarrays and spot signals, the proxy for tRNA levels, are quantified by phosphorimaging. Features such as reproducibility and specificity were assessed using several tRNA subpopulations. Dynamic range and sensitivity were evaluated by overexpressing specific tRNA species. SPOt does not require any amplification or post-extraction labeling and can be adapted to any organism. It is modular and easily streamlined with popular techniques such as polysome fractionation to profile tRNAs interacting with ribosomes and actively engaged in translation. The biological relevance of these data is discussed in regards to codon usage, tRNA gene copy number, and position on the genome.Influence of Freeze-Thaw Cycles on RNA Integrity of Gastrointestinal Cancer and Matched Adjacent Tissues. Comparative analysis of RNA expression profiles between cancer and adjacent noncancerous tissues is an important part of cancer research. High-quality RNA is essential for consistent, reliable results, especially for identification of cancer. However, the impact of freeze-thaw cycles on the quality of RNA both in cancer and paired adjacent tissues is still unclear. To investigate the influence of freeze-thaw cycles on RNA integrity and overall histomorphology of cancer and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. Gastrointestinal cancer and matched adjacent noncancerous tissues were frozen and thawed twice before extracting RNA. Total RNA in each sample was extracted with TRIzol reagents and the RNA integrity was assessed by RNA integrity number (RIN) on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Light microscopy was then used to assess tissue composition and morphology. RIN values for all samples tended to correlation with the frequency of freeze-thawing. With an RIN cutoff value of 6, RNA extracted from cancer tissues was not qualified after the first freeze-thaw. Moreover, all RNA extracted from adjacent noncancerous tissues had nonqualifying RIN scores after the first freeze-thaw except for tissues. Microscopically, all samples displayed qualified tissue morphology regardless of freeze-thaw frequency. Freeze-thawing affects the RNA integrity, but not the tissue morphology of gastrointestinal cancer and paired adjacent noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, the RNA extracted from adjacent noncancerous tissues is more easily degraded than that in cancer tissues.Preventive supplementation with fresh and preserved peach attenuates CCl4-induced oxidative stress, inflammation and tissue damage. The present study was elaborated to comparatively evaluate the preventive effect of different peach-derived products obtained from preserved fruits (Syrup and Preserve Pulp Peach [PPP]) and from fresh peels and pulps (Peel and Fresh Pulp Peach [FPP]) in a model of liver/renal toxicity and inflammation induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in rats. Tissue damage (carbonyl, thiobarbituric acid reactive species and sulfhydril), antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase and superoxide dismutase) and inflammatory parameters [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta levels, and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) and nuclear factor (NF)kB-p65 immunocontent] were investigated. Our findings demonstrated that Peel, PPP and FPP (200 or 400 mg/kg) daily administration by oral gavage for 30 days conferred a protection against CCl4-induced antioxidant enzymes. This antioxidant/anti-inflammatory effect seems to be associated with the abundance of carotenoids and polyphenols present in peach-derived products, which are enriched in fresh-fruit-derived preparations (Peel and FPP) but are also present in PPP. Therefore, the herein presented results show evidence that supplementation with peach products may be protective against organ caused by oxidative stress, being interesting candidates for production of antioxidant-enriched functional foods.Septic endarteritis due to intra-arterial catheters for cancer chemotherapy. I. Evaluation of an outbreak. II. Risk factors, clinical features and management, III. Guidelines for prevention. A cluster of three cases of staphylococcal septic endarteritis originating from percutaneously inserted brachial artery catheters for regional cancer chemotherapy prompted an epidemiologic and clinical study of bacteremic infections associated with this therapeutic modality. Nine cases were identified over a 3 1/2-year period (1.6% of all catheterizations), all caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The cluster followed discontinuation of hexachlorophene for scrub of the extremity prior to cannulation phage-typing suggested the three cases were caused by the patients' own strains of Staphylococcus. These infections produced a distinctive clinical syndrome which facilitates implicating the catheter in the genesis of fever occurring in a patient receiving intra-arterial chemotherapy: early localized pain (89%) and hemorrhage (78%), and Osler's nodes distally (44%), later followed by local inflammation (78%), purulence (56%) and signs of systemic sepsis (100%) (each factor, p less than or equal to .005). Duration of cannulation did not influence susceptibility to infection. However, difficult cannulations or need for repositioning the catheter (p = .0096), prior radiation therapy (p = .033), leukopenia (p less than .05) and hypoalbuminemia (p less than .05) were all associated with septicemia. In the 25 months since implementation of specific control measures, there have been no further catheter-related septicemia in 310 catheterization (p less than .001). Guide-lines for prevention and management of these infections are provided.NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Pentachlorophenol (CAS NO. 87-86-5) in F344/N Rats (Feed Studies). Pentachlorophenol has been used as an herbicide, algicide, defoliant, wood preservative, germicide, fungicide, and molluscicide. Pentachlorophenol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute for carcinogenicity testing based on its widespread use as a wood preservative, potential for entering the environment (pentachlorophenol residues have been found worldwide in soil, water, and air samples in food products and in human and animal tissues and body fluids), and likelihood of bioaccumulation in the environment (pentachlorophenol is persistent in soil, having a half-life of up to 5 years). Technical Report No. 349 contains the results of the 2-year studies of pentachlorophenol performed by the NTP with B6C3F1 mice. Male and female F344/N rats were exposed to pentachlorophenol (approximately 99% pure) in feed for 28 days or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in vitro in Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells and in vivo in rat and mouse bone marrow cells. 28-DAY STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats were given 0, 200, 400, 800, 1,600, or 3,200 ppm pentachlorophenol, equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 20, 40, 75, 150, or 270 mg pentachlorophenol/kg body weight to males and females in feed for 28 days. With the exception of one male and two females exposed to 3,200 ppm, all rats survived until the end of the study. The final mean body weights and body weight gains of male rats exposed to 1,600 or 3,200 ppm and female rats exposed to 400, 800, 1,600, or 3,200 ppm were significantly less than those of the controls rats exposed to 3,200 ppm lost weight during the study. Feed consumption by 3,200 ppm males was less than that by the control group throughout the study. The absolute and relative liver weights of 400, 800, and 1,600 ppm males and all exposed groups of females were significantly greater than those of the controls. Compared to the control groups, the incidences of minimal to mild hepatocyte degeneration in males and females exposed to 400 ppm or greater and the incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy in the 3,200 ppm groups were increased. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were fed diets containing 200, 400, or 600 ppm pentachlorophenol (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) for 105 weeks. Stop-exposure groups of 60 male and 60 female rats received 1,000 ppm (equivalent to 60 mg/kg) in feed for 52 weeks, after which animals received undosed feed for the remainder of the 2-year study 10 male and 10 female control and 1,000 ppm rats were evaluated at 7 months. Survival, Body Weights,and Feed Consumption: In the 2-year study, survival of 600 and 1,000 ppm males was greater than that of the controls. Mean body weights of 400 and 600 ppm males and females were generally less than those of controls. When exposure to pentachlorophenol was discontinued at week 52, mean body weights of 1,000 ppm males and females were 17%% and 22%% lower than those of the respective controls however, by the end of week 87, the mean body weights were similar to those of the controls. Generally, feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls. Pathology Findings: At 2 years, the incidence of malignant mesothelioma originating from the tunica vaginalis was significantly greater in 1,000 ppm males than in the controls, and the incidence exceeded the historical control range. Nasal squamous cell carcinomas were present in one control male, three 200 ppm males, one 400 ppm male, and five 1,000 ppm males at 2 years, and the incidence in 1,000 ppm males exceeded the historical control range. At the 7-month interim evaluation, the incidences of centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy in 1,000 ppm males and females and hepatocyte cytoplasmic vacuolization in 1,000 ppm males was significantly greater than those in the controls. At 2 years, the incidences of several nonneoplastic liver lesions including hepatodiaphragmatic nodules and hepatocyte cystic degeneration in all exposed ation in all exposed groups of males and basophilic foci in 1,000 ppm males were increased compared to the controls. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Pentachlorophenol (91.6%percnt pure) was tested in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 at doses up to 30 mug/plate with and without induced rat or hamster liver S9 no significant increases in the number of revertant colonies were observed in any of the strain/activation combinations. When tested for cytogenetic effects in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, pentachlorophenol was weakly positive for induction of sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations. In the sister chromatid exchange test, a weakly positive response was observed within a concentration range of 3 to 30 mug/mL in the absence of S9 with S9, no induction of sister chromatid exchanges was noted. In the chromosomal aberrations test, pentachlorophenol was negative without S9 but induced small but significant increases in the frequency of aberrant cells in the presence of S9 at doses of 80 and 100 mug/mL. In contrast to the positive in vitro results in the test for induction of chromosomal aberrations, no increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was noted in bone marrow of male rats or mice administered pentachlorophenol by intraperitoneal injection three times at 24 hour intervals. The highest dose administered to rats (75 mg/kg) and mice (150 mg/kg) was lethal. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this 2-year feed study, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachlorophenol in male or female F344/N rats fed diets containing 200, 400, or 600 ppm. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachlorophenol in male F344/N rats given feed containing 1,000 ppm for 1 year followed by control feed for 1 year (stop-exposure study), based on increased incidences of mesothelioma and nasal squamous cell carcinoma. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachlorophenol in female rats given feed containing 1,000 ppm for 1 year and maintained on control feed for 1 year. Stop-exposure males and females recovered from a transitory reduction in body weight gain by the end of the 2-year study, and males had increased survival compared to the controls. Counting missing values in a metabolite-intensity data set for measuring the analytical performance of a metabolomics platform. Metabolomics requires quantitative comparison of individual metabolites present in an entire sample set. Unfortunately, missing intensity values in one or more samples are very common. Because missing values can have a profound influence on metabolomic results, the extent of missing values found in a metabolomic data set should be treated as an important parameter for measuring the analytical performance of a technique. In this work, we report a study on the scope of missing values and a robust method of filling the missing values in a chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS metabolomics platform. Unlike conventional LC-MS, CIL LC-MS quantifies the concentration differences of individual metabolites in two comparative samples based on the mass spectral peak intensity ratio of a peak pair from a mixture of differentially labeled samples. We show that this peak-pair feature can be explored as a unique means of extracting metabolite intensity information from raw mass spectra. In our approach, a peak-pair peaking algorithm, IsoMS, is initially used to process the LC-MS data set to generate a CSV file or table that contains metabolite ID and peak ratio information (i.e., metabolite-intensity table). A zero-fill program, freely available from MyCompoundID.org , is developed to automatically find a missing value in the CSV file and go back to the raw LC-MS data to find the peak pair and, then, calculate the intensity ratio and enter the ratio value into the table. Most of the missing values are found to be low abundance peak pairs. We demonstrate the performance of this method in analyzing an experimental and technical replicate data set of human urine metabolome. Furthermore, we propose a standardized approach of counting missing values in a replicate data set as a way of gauging the extent of missing values in a metabolomics platform. Finally, we illustrate that applying the zero-fill program, in conjunction with dansylation CIL LC-MS, can lead to a marked improvement in finding significant metabolites that differentiate bladder cancer patients and their controls in a metabolomics study of 109 subjects. Synthesis of [11C]FEDAA1106 as a new PET imaging probe of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor expression. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is associated with neuroinflammation and tumor progression. [(11)C]DAA1106 and [(18)F]FEDAA1106 are two promising radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of PBR. This study was designed to develop a new radiolabeled analog of [(11)C]DAA1106 and [(18)F]FEDAA1106, [(11)C]FEDAA1106, for PET imaging of PBR expression in brain and cancer. Precursor N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-5-hydroxybenzyl)acetamide (9) was synthesized in multiple steps with moderate to high chemical yields. Precursor 9 was labeled by [(11)C]CH(3)OTf and isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification to provide target radioligand N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-5-[(11)C]methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(11)C]FEDAA1106, [(11)C]10) in 60-70% radiochemical yields, decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB), based on [(11)C]CO(2). The specific activity of the radiotracer [(11)C]10 was in a range of 111-185GBq/micromol at the end of synthesis (EOS).The Application of Sigmoid Sinus Tunnel-packing or Push-packing of the Inferior Petrous Sinus in the Microsurgical Management of Jugular Paragangliomas. To analyze the outcomes of microsurgically treated jugular paragangliomas with control of bleeding from the inferior petrous sinus. Retrospective patient review. A single university hospital. Forty-three patients with jugular paragangliomas were diagnosed in the past 7 years in our clinic. Surgical tumor control, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative management of the facial nerve, and the preoperative and postoperative function of the lower central nerves. Twenty-six patients underwent microsurgical treatment. Eighteen tumors were class C2 (69.2%), six were class C3 (23.1%), and two were class CDe1 (7.7%). Gross total tumor resection was achieved in 92.3% of the patients. The mean blood loss during surgery was 438.5 ml. The recurrence rate was 3.8% over a mean follow-up of 29.2 months. New facial palsy and lower cranial nerve deficit occurred in 42.3 and 11.5% of the patients, respectively. The infratemporal fossa approach type A with sigmoid sinus tunnel-packing or push-packing technique facilitated the control of bleeding from the inferior petrous sinus and improved the outcomes of microsurgical treatment for jugular paragangliomas.Exact statistical tests for any carcinogenic effect in animal bioassays. II. Age-adjusted tests. Statistical methods are discussed for application in animal carcinogenesis bioassays that test a general null hypothesis that response frequencies are independent of the treatment level for all tumor endpoints, sexes, and species considered in the bioassay, conditional on survival. These methods are similar to those proposed earlier by Farrar and Crump (1988, Fundam, Appl. Toxicol. 11, 652-663) which involve test statistics that are functions of p values from multiple standard statistical hypothesis tests, and evaluation of significance using randomization. Refinements include the introduction of an exact incidental tumor test analogous to the asymptotic test of Hoel and Walburg (1972, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 49, 361-372), which takes into account the possibility that any differences among treatment groups in response rates result from differences in survival that is independent of tumors. Additional consideration is given to selection of test statistics, and a test is proposed that is sensitive specifically to cases where the same tumor endpoints are affected in multiple sexes and species. Applications of the procedures to results of National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassays concerning decabromodiphenyl oxide and iodinated glycerol illustrate the sensitivity of tests based on different test statistics to distinct alternative hypotheses. When compared with the qualitative conclusions of the NTP regarding the strength of evidence for a carcinogenic effect in the same bioassays, the results presented suggest that the methods can be useful in clarifying otherwise equivocal evidence for carcinogenicity. Various difficulties are discussed relevant to the construction of exact combined fatal and incidental tumor tests analogous to the tests of Peto et al. (1980, IARC Monogr. Suppl. 2).A birth cohort analysis of the incidence of papillary thyroid cancer in the United States, 1973-2004. The incidence of papillary thyroid cancer has been reported to be increasing during the past three decades, with a 65-126% increase between 1975 and 2004. The reason for the increase is currently unknown. This study examined the incidence pattern of papillary thyroid cancer in the United States, and evaluated the components of birth cohort (defined based on year of birth), time period, and age as determinants of the observed time trend of the disease. Using the data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program for 1973-2004, we conducted both univariate analysis and age-period-cohort modeling to evaluate birth cohort patterns and evaluate age, period, and cohort effects on incidence trends over time. The increasing incidence showed a clear birth cohort pattern for both men and women. The results from age-period-cohort modeling showed that, while period effect appeared to have had an impact on the observed incidence trends, birth cohort effect may also explain part of the increasing trend in papillary thyroid carcinoma during the study period, especially among women. While a period effect that is likely due to advancements in diagnostic techniques and increased medical detection of small thyroid nodules may explain some of the observed increase in the incidence, we speculate that birth cohort-related changes in environmental exposures (such as increased exposure to diagnostic X-rays and polybrominated diphenyl ethers) have also contributed to the observed increase in papillary thyroid cancer during the past decades.Partial hepatectomy on cirrhotic liver with a right lateral tumor. A total of 24 patients with cirrhotic liver and solitary, small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) located at the lateral part of the right lobe underwent surgery with our technique of hepatic clamping and finger dissection. There were no operative mortality or acute or chronic hepatic failure. Total operating time was 129 +/- 20 minutes actual resection time was only 22.7 +/- 4.9 minutes. The average amount of blood transfused during this procedure was 1552 +/- 909 ml. The preoperative serum bromsulphalein retention rate proportionately reflected the postoperative peak serum conjugated bilirubin concentration if the weight of the resected specimen was less than 310 gm (p less than 0.001). An evaluation of the enzymes (SGOT, SGPT, and lactate dehydrogenase) released from liver cells on the first postoperative day found that more prominent elevation was observed in the group of patients with hypotension than in those without hypotension (all p less than 0.001). Although all enzyme levels returned to the preoperative level on the fourteenth postoperative day, the excretory capacity of liver cells as measured by serum bromsulphalein retention rate on day 14 time was still abnormally high (p less than 0.001) and took 2 to 3 months to decline to a level that still exceeded preoperative levels (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, partial hepatectomy on cirrhotic liver by hepatic clamping and finger dissection was a simple, rapid technique without any serious side effects.Application of silver stains to cytologic specimens of neuroendocrine tumors metastatic to the liver. Cytologic specimens of neuroendocrine tumors metastatic to the liver were examined with regard to their silver staining properties after the application of argentaffin and argyrophil staining techniques (Masson, Grimelius and Sevier-Munger). In tumors with a content of serotonin (small intestine carcinoids), the presence of this substance was demonstrated cytologically as an argentaffin reaction in individual tumor cells however, formalin fixation was a prerequisite for positive staining. Melanin in malignant melanoma cells displayed a positive argentaffin reaction, irrespective of the fixation used (air drying, formalin, Bouin's fluid or acetone-alcohol). Thus, serotonin and melanin can be distinguished in cytologic samples of neuroendocrine tumors by the use of the Masson argentaffin reaction with different fixatives. The nonargentaffin-positive neuroendocrine were weakly stained or unreactive with the Grimelius argyrophil technique. The Sevier-Munger argyrophil technique was negative or gave a disturbing nonspecific background staining reaction that was difficult to interpret in the cytologic samples. Thus, the Grimelius method appears to be the most useful silver stain for identifying neuroendocrine tumor cells in cytologic material, irrespective of their hormone content, since both argentaffin-positive and argentaffin-negative samples were stained at least to some degree.Cell blotting: techniques for staining and microscopical examination of cells blotted on nitrocellulose paper. Standard cytological and histological staining procedures were successfully applied on nitrocellulose (NC) paper for staining a spectrum of cell types that were blotted on it. The staining procedures included a Papanicolaou method, a hematoxylin and eosin method, and an immunoperoxidase technique. The types consisted of various suspension and monolayer cultures as well as freshly prepared from tumor and nontumor tissues. Suspended cells were manually blotted on NC paper they were fixed in one of the fixatives, which included 80% 2-propanol, 10% neutral-buffered formalin, Carnoy's solution, Bouin's fluid, and B-5 fixative they were then stained by one or more of the above methods. After staining, the NC paper was dehydrated in absolute 2-propanol made transparent by soaking in xylene mounted permanently in a mounting medium (Permount) on a glass slide and then examined under a microscope. The protein-blotting capacity of NC paper (Schleicher  Schuell) was compared with those of the conventional cell blotting media (Millipore and Gelman) which contained cellulose acetate. Bovine serum albumin was dot-blotted on the NC and the cellulose acetate filters, and stained for protein by amido black. As in cytological/histological staining, the amido black-stained filters were dehydrated in absolute 2-propanol, made transparent in xylene, and mounted in Permount. Densitometric tracings indicated that the NC paper bound the highest amount of protein. The feasibility of cytological/histological staining techniques on NC paper combined with its high protein-blotting capacity allowed in situ staining and microscopical characterization of baby hamster kidney cells binding to fibronectin blotted on the NC paper. The possible significance of these techniques in current cell biological research was discussed.Cytologic diagnosis of a medullary carcinoma of the thyroid by Sevier-Munger silver staining and calcitonin immunocytochemistry. A medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was preoperatively diagnosed on ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration biopsies. After cytocentrifugation, the tumor cells displayed a dense cytoplasmic silver granulation with the Sevier-Munger technique when applied to air-dried or acetone-ethanol-fixed samples and an obvious calcitonin immunoreactivity after fixation in Bouin's fluid. These methods may prove useful in the identification of nonpalpable metastases and recurrences of medullary carcinomas of the thyroid, especially since the cytologic typing of medullary thyroid carcinoma cells may be difficult with routine stainings.Sorting out mix-ups. The provenance of tissue sections may be confirmed by PCR using microsatellite markers. Standard identification systems usually ensure that biopsy material is correctly associated with a given patient. Sometimes, as when a tumor is unexpectedly found, the provenance (proof of origin) of a tissue sample may be questioned the tissue may have been mislabelled or contaminated with tissue from another patient. Techniques used to confirm tissue provenance include comparing either tissue markers of gender or ABO blood groups however, these methods have weak confirmatory power. Recently, the use of DNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques has been reported. Paired, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, 10 microns tissue sections were selected from 17 patients, 8 of whom had carcinoma, either by dividing a biopsy section, using sequential biopsies, or sequential biopsy and autopsy tissue. The resulting 36 samples were coded before analysis. In two additional cases, 1-mm fragments of tumor from one patient were included in the tissue block of benign tissue from another patient, the tumor fragments were identified on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections, separately scraped off the glass slide, and analyzed. Tissue from two clinical cases, one of suspected mislabelling and one with a suspected carry-over of malignant tissue were also investigated. Short tandem repeat sequences (STR) or microsatellites, are 2-5 base pair repeats that vary in their repeat number between individuals. This variation (polymorphism) can be assessed using a PCR. A panel of markers of 3 STRs ACPP, INT 2, and CYP 19 (on chromosomes 3, 11, and 15, respectively) were used. DNA was isolated from the samples after xylene deparaffinization and proteinase digestion, and was then amplified in a radioactive PCR using primers selected to give a product size ranging from 136-178 bases. Amplified products were electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, dried, and autoradiographed. DNA segments were successfully extracted from all samples but one, which was fixed in Bouin's fluid. By comparing allele sizes from the panel, all tissue pairs (other than the Bouin's pair) were successfully matched, the 1-mm tumor fragments were correctly assigned, and the two clinical problems were solved. STRs are highly informative and robust markers, well suited to PCR of small portions of tissue sections, and are an effective method to confirm the provenance of benign and malignant biopsy and autopsy material.Caveolin-1 as a potential high-risk prostate cancer biomarker. Current diagnostic techniques of prostate cancer cannot efficiently distinguish the latent and low-risk forms from the high-risk significant forms of prostate cancer. Caveolin-1 (Cav-1), except other functions, plays an important role in cell transformation and the process of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, Cav-1 is involved in metastatic processes. It has also been shown that Cav-1 expression is induced under stress conditions, such as oxidative stress. The present study focused on the determination of prognostic markers of aggressive (high-grade) forms of prostate cancer. We determined serum Cav-1 and serum markers of antioxidant activity-glutathione (GSH), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), N,N-dimethyl-1,4-diaminobenzene (DMPD), free radicals method (FRK) and blue chromium peroxide (Cro) in 97 serum samples (82 prostate cancer patients and 15 controls). We found insignificant differences in Cav-1 between the sera of patients and controls (5.69√å√¢ in the cancer group vs. 5.42√å√¢ ng/ml in the control group). However, we found a significant (p<0.004) 2.8-fold elevation of Cav-1 in high tumor stages (TNM T4) compared to lower stages and a significant positive association with histological grading (r=0.29, p=0.028). We also found that in patients with high serum Cav-1 the antioxidant capacity of the body is reduced. These findings indicate that Cav-1 may be an interesting tool for the prediction of disease burden.Cyclotron production of (44)Sc: From bench to bedside. (44)Sc, a PET radionuclide, has promising decay characteristics (T1/2 = 3.97 h, Ebeta(+)av = 632 keV) for nuclear imaging and is an attractive alternative to the short-lived (68)Ga (T1/2 = 68 min, Ebeta(+)av = 830 keV). The aim of this study was the optimization of the (44)Sc production process at an accelerator, allowing its use for preclinical and clinical PET imaging. (44)CaCO3 targets were prepared and irradiated with protons (~11 MeV) at a beam current of 50 √å?√•?A for 90 min. (44)Sc was separated from its target material using DGA extraction resin and concentrated using SCX cation exchange resin. Radiolabeling experiments at activities up to 500 MBq and stability tests were performed with DOTANOC by investigating different scavengers, including gentisic acid. Dynamic PET of an AR42J tumor-bearing mouse was performed after injection of (44)Sc-DOTANOC. The optimized chemical separation method yielded up to 2 GBq (44)Sc of high radionuclidic purity. In the presence of gentisic acid, radiolabeling of (44)Sc with DOTANOC was achieved with a radiochemical yield of ~99% at high specific activity (10 MBq/nmol) and quantities which would allow clinical application. The dynamic PET images visualized increasing uptake of (44)Sc-DOTANOC into AR42J tumors and excretion of radioactivity through the kidneys of the investigated mouse. The concept from-bench-to-bedside was clearly demonstrated in this extended study using cyclotron-produced (44)Sc. Sufficiently high activities of (44)Sc of excellent radionuclidic purity are obtainable for clinical application, by irradiation of enriched calcium at a cyclotron. This work demonstrates a promising basis for introducing (44)Sc to clinical routine of nuclear imaging using PET.Good results after Hartmann's operation for rectal cancer in high risk patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of per- and postoperative complications of low anterior resection and Hartmann's operation (HO) for rectal cancer. The study was performed in a department with a high frequency of HO. Patients who had undergone low anterior resection (LA) or HO for rectal cancer at the Department of Surgery, Gentofte Hospital, between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2007. A total of 187 patients were operated using LA or HO technique during this period. LA was performed in 103 patients and HO in 84 patients. ASA-scores were significantly higher for patients who underwent HO (p = 0.0066). There was no significant difference in complication rates between the two groups (p = 0.385). The 30-day mortality rate was 3.2% (n = 6) for all patients, and it was not significantly different between the two groups (HO 3.6% (n = 3) and LA= 2.9% (n = 3), p = 1). One ASA III patient who underwent LA died from anastomotic leakage whereas no ASA III patients operated with HO died. There was no significant difference between the groups for any other per- and postoperative complication. In this material, HO rather than LA seems to be the safer choice for high risk rectal cancer patients with ASA > 3 in terms of mortality rate compared with the national index.Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of osteoid osteomas: technique and results. Osteoid osteoma is a benign primary bone tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. Besides local pain, which is often worse at night, prompt relief due to medication with acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) is characteristic for this bone lesion. Because long-term medication with ASS does not represent an alternative treatment strategy due to its potentially severe side effects, different minimally invasive image-guided techniques for the therapy of osteoid osteoma have been developed. In this context radiofrequency (RF) ablation in particular has become part of the clinical routine. The technique and results of image-guided RF ablation are compared to alternative treatment strategies. Using this technique, an often needle-shaped RF applicator is percutaneously placed into the tumor under image guidance. Then a high-frequency alternating current is applied by the tip of the applicator which leads to ionic motion within the tissue resulting in local heat development and thus in thermal destruction of the surrounding tissue including the tumor. The published primary and secondary success rates of this technique are 87 and 83 %, respectively. Surgical resection and open curettage show comparable success rates but are associated with higher complication rates. In addition image-guided RF ablation of osteoid osteomas is associated with low costs. In conclusion image-guided RF ablation can be considered the gold standard for the treatment of osteoid osteomaThe effects of oral acetylsalicylic acid on√å√¢ blood fluidity and infusion speed in√å√¢ the√å√¢ cancer patients with PICC. This study aimed to examine the influence of oral acetylsalicylic acid on blood fluidity and infusion speed in the cancer patients with Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC). PICC is placed for prolonged chemotherapy of cancer patients. The fibrin sheaths, which consist of cellular substance and non-cellular substance, generate at the place of insertion and grow down all over the catheter. Finally they cover the vent of the catheter and lead to catheter dysfunctions such as the decrease of infusion speed. In addition, the high viscosity status of cancer patients could lead to acute embolization, which adds to the high risk of death. Randomized controlled trial. This research was carried out between April 2013 and January 2014 in the second hospital of Xiangya, Central South University in Changsha, China. Initially 96 cancer participants with PICC were chosen and randomly allocated to experimental and control group. The participants of the experimental group were conducted route PICC maintain technique and took acetylsalicylic acid 100√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ämg per day after dinner, while the control group received route PICC maintain technique only. The infusion speed and hemorheology indexes of the two groups were tested before our study and at the end of the 2nd and 4th months with several instruments. Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated that taking acetylsalicylic acid orally had significant main effect on high shear blood viscosity and red blood cell deformability index (P√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ä<√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ä0.05), and it also had significant main effect as well as time effect on plasma viscosity (P√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ä<√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ä0.05) and time had significant main effect as well as interaction effect with oral acetylsalicylic acid on low shear blood viscosity and red blood cell aggregation index (P√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ä<√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ä0.05). Repeated measures ANOVA also showed that taking acetylsalicylic acid orally had significant main effect, time effect and interaction effect on infusion speed (P√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ä<√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬Å√ä0.01). Oral acetylsalicylic acid could improve hemorheology condition and the infusion speed related to fibrin sheath in the cancer patients.Prevention of pelvic radiation disease. Pelvic cancers are among the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide. Treatment of patients requires a multidisciplinary approach that frequently includes radiotherapy. Gastrointestinal (GI) radiation-induced toxicity is a major complication and the transient or long-term problems, ranging from mild to very severe, arising in non-cancerous tissues resulting from radiation treatment to a tumor of pelvic origin, are actually called as pelvic radiation disease. The incidence of pelvic radiation disease changes according to the radiation technique, the length of follow up, the assessment method, the type and stage of cancer and several other variables. Notably, even with the most recent radiation techniques, i.e., intensity-modulated radiotherapy, the incidence of radiation-induced GI side effects is overall reduced but still not negligible. In addition, radiation-induced GI side effects can develop even after several decades therefore, the improvement of patient life expectancy will unavoidably increase the risk of developing radiation-induced complications. Once developed, the management of pelvic radiation disease may be challenging. Therefore, the prevention of radiation-induced toxicity represents a reasonable way to avoid a dramatic drop of the quality of life of these patients. In the current manuscript we provide an updated and practical review on the best available evidences in the field of the prevention of pelvic radiation disease. Diagnosis of 25 genotypes of human papillomaviruses for their physical statuses in cervical precancerous/cancerous lesions: a comparison of E2/E6E7 ratio-based vs. multiple E1-L1/E6E7 ratio-based detection techniques. Cervical lesions caused by integrated human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are highly dangerous because they can quickly develop into invasive cancers. However, clinicians are currently hampered by the lack of a quick, convenient and precise technique to detect integrated/mixed infections of various genotypes of HPVs in the cervix. This study aimed to develop a practical tool to determine the physical status of different HPVs and evaluate its clinical significance. The target population comprised 1162 women with an HPV infection history of√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°>√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°six months and an abnormal cervical cytological finding. The multiple E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis, a novel technique, was developed based on determining the ratios of E1/E6E7, E2/E6E7, E4E5/E6E7, L2/E6E7 and L1/E6E7 within the viral genome. Any imbalanced ratios indicate integration. Its diagnostic and predictive performances were compared with those of E2/E6E7 ratio analysis. The detection accuracy of both techniques was evaluated using the gold-standard technique detection of integrated papillomavirus sequences (DIPS). To realize a multigenotypic detection goal, a primer and probe library was established. The integration rate of a particular genotype of HPV was correlated with its tumorigenic potential and women with higher lesion grades often carried lower viral loads. The E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis achieved 92.7% sensitivity and 99.0% specificity in detecting HPV integration, while the E2/E6E7 ratio analysis showed a much lower sensitivity (75.6%) and a similar specificity (99.3%). Interference due to episomal copies was observed in both techniques, leading to false-negative results. However, some positive results of E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis were missed by DIPS due to its stochastic detection nature. The E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis is more efficient than E2/E6E7 ratio analysis and DIPS in predicting precancerous/cancerous lesions, in which both positive predictive values (36.7%-82.3%) and negative predictive values (75.9%-100%) were highest (based on the results of three rounds of biopsies). The multiple E1-L1/E6E7 ratio analysis is more sensitive and predictive than E2/E6E7 ratio analysis as a triage test for detecting HPV integration. It can effectively narrow the range of candidates for colposcopic examination and cervical biopsy, thereby lowering the expense of cervical cancer prevention.Detection and Mapping of DNA Methylation with 2D Material Nanopores. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involving the addition of a methyl group to DNA, which is heavily involved in gene expression and regulation, thereby critical to the progression of diseases such as cancer. In this work we show that detection and localization of DNA methylation can be achieved with nanopore sensors made of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and molybdenum di-sulphide (MoS2). We label each DNA methylation site with a methyl-CpG binding domain protein (MBD1), and combine molecular dynamics simulations with electronic transport calculations to investigate the translocation of the methylated DNA-MBD1 complex through 2D material nanopores under external voltage biases. The passage of the MBD1-labeled methylation site through the pore is identified by dips in the current blockade induced by the DNA strand, as well as by peaks in the transverse electronic sheet current across the 2D layer. The position of the methylation sites can be clearly recognized by the relative positions of the dips in the recorded ionic current blockade with an estimated error ranging from 0% to 16%. Finally, we define the spatial resolution of the 2D material nanopore device as the minimal distance between two methylation sites identified within a single measurement, which is 15 base pairs by ionic current recognition, but as low as 10 base pairs by transverse electronic conductance detection, indicating better resolution with this latter technique. The present approach opens a new route for precise and efficient profiling of DNA methylation.Partition of protein and DNA during cytokinesis in human breast cancer cell lines. Three human breast cancer cell lines (HTB-126, MDA-231, and HTB-122) with DNA index (DI) values between 1.26 and 1.72 were analysed together with a diploid mouse embryonal carcinoma cell line (PCC3) by a TV-video time-lapse technique (pedigree analysis). Cytochemical parameters (DNA and proteins) were studied in individual cells in a rapid scanning microspectrophotometer. Post-mitotic sister cell pairs were analysed after Feulgen-naphthol-yellow staining. The DI values of the cell lines were selected to reflect various well-known clinical ploidy entities differing in malignancy potentials. A mitotic disturbance of the partition of DNA and protein to daughter cells was found in particular in MDA-231 closest to the triploid DNA modal value (DI = 1.37). Duration of mitosis was considerably longer in the near triploid line compared to the other lines. The MDA-231 line was also least sensitive to suboptimal growth conditions. This report calls attention to a possible causality between mitotic error and intraclonal genotype and cell mass heterogeneity.Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in human cancer cell lines is increased by hypoxia. Malignant neoplasms commonly have increased rates of glucose utilization, poor perfusion and areas of low oxygenation. Autoradiographic studies of excised tumors have shown increased FDG uptake in viable cells near necrotic portions of tumor. We evaluated in vitro whether tumor cell FDG uptake increased with hypoxia. The uptake of 3H-FDG into two human tumor cell lines (HTB 63 melanoma and HTB 77 IP3 ovarian carcinoma) was determined after exposure to differing oxygen atmospheres ranging from 0% to 20% O2 for varying time periods. Glucose transport was independently determined as well as estimates of the level of Glut-1 glucose transporter membrane protein. FDG uptake in both the melanoma and the ovarian carcinoma cell lines increased significantly (39.6% +/- 6.7% and 36.7% +/- 9%, respectively) over basal (20% O2) conditions when cells were exposed to a mild hypoxic environment (5% O2) for 1.5 hr. With a 4-hr exposure to 1.5% O2, the increase in FDG uptake was greater at 52.3% +/- 8.9% and 43.5% +/- 19%, respectively. With 4 hr of anoxia, the increase in FDG uptake over basal conditions was 42.7% +/- 10% and 63.3% +/- 13.7% for melanoma and ovarian carcinoma cells, respectively. Membrane transport of 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG) was increased by hypoxia for melanoma and ovarian carcinoma. Immunochemical assays for Glut-1 showed an increase in the membrane expression of the Glut-1 transporter in cells exposed to hypoxia. Hypoxia increases cellular uptake of FDG in two different malignant human cell lines. Increased glucose transport, in part due to increased membrane expression of the Glut-1 glucose transporter, contributes to this phenomenon. Increased FDG uptake in tumors visualized during PET imaging may be partly reflective of tumor hypoxia.Development of sustained delivery system as a novel technique for tissue culture. One of the greatest advances for biomedical research has been the use of tissue culture to study the effects and the mode of action of various organic compounds. However, there are myriad problems associated with the classical approach to pharmaceutical studies in tissue culture, such as contamination, the logistical problems inherent in intermittent dosing, and near-lethal drug doses required to achieve effective physiological doses. This has given impetus to a search for better means of effective delivery routes in a tissue culture setting. The specific objectives of this investigation were: (1) to develop a ceramic delivery system for the novel purpose of releasing sustained levels of the anti-cancer drug combination inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) + inositol (I) in a tissue culture setting (2) to assess the proliferation rate and viability of HTB 122 Intraductile Breast Cancer (IBC) cells exposed to sustained levels of IP6 + I compared to conventional means of drug delivery (dissolved in media) (3) to evaluate the morphological changes associated with this treatment process. Sterile aseptic techniques were employed during the entire study (72 hours of incubation). Data obtained from this investigation suggests the following: (1) TCPL delivery system can be utilized in the tissue culture setting to deliver IP6 + I in a sustained manner for 72 hours (2) the use of IP6 + I at the physiological dose did not induce any significant change in the biochemical marker (MDA) (3) morphological evaluation of cells treated with sustained delivery resulted in cellular atrophy, as well as fragmentation, compared to the treatment by conventional means and to the sham group (empty capsule) and (4) regardless of route of administration, treatment with IP6 + I resulted in a decrease in total protein content compared to the sham capsules and control groups. In conclusion, this approach is a novel use of ceramic delivery systems in tissue culture that gives breakthrough information for basic research on limiting and eliminating contamination and the logistical problems associated with intermittent dosing in tissue culture.Magnetic resonance imaging with hyperpolarized agents: methods and applications. In the past decade, hyperpolarized (HP) contrast agents have been under active development for MRI applications to address the twin challenges of functional and quantitative imaging. Both HP helium (3He) and xenon (129Xe) gases have reached the stage where they are under study in clinical research. HP 129Xe, in particular, is poised for larger scale clinical research to investigate asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and fibrotic lung diseases. With advances in polarizer technology and unique capabilities for imaging of 129Xe gas exchange into lung tissue and blood, HP 129Xe MRI is attracting new attention. In parallel, HP 13C and 15N MRI methods have steadily advanced in a wide range of pre-clinical research applications for imaging metabolism in various cancers and cardiac disease. The HP [1-13C] pyruvate MRI technique, in particular, has undergone phase I trials in prostate cancer and is poised for investigational new drug trials at multiple institutions in cancer and cardiac applications. This review treats the methodology behind both HP gases and HP 13C and 15N liquid state agents. Gas and liquid phase HP agents share similar technologies for achieving non-equilibrium polarization outside the field of the MRI scanner, strategies for image data acquisition, and translational challenges in moving from pre-clinical to clinical research. To cover the wide array of methods and applications, this review is organized by numerical section into (1) a brief introduction, (2) the physical and biological properties of the most common polarized agents with a brief summary of applications and methods of polarization, (3) methods for image acquisition and reconstruction specific to improving data acquisition efficiency for HP MRI, (4) the main physical properties that enable unique measures of physiology or metabolic pathways, followed by a more detailed review of the literature describing the use of HP agents to study: (5) metabolic pathways in cancer and cardiac disease and (6) lung function in both pre-clinical and clinical research studies, concluding with (7) some future directions and challenges, and (8) an overall summary.Minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer. Initial follow-up. An analysis was performed to evaluate early patterns of recurrence and survival in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for primary colorectal cancer. Thirty-nine patients are available with a minimum of 24 months postoperative follow-up. The techniques and expected surgical outcomes for patients undergoing laparoscopically assisted colectomies are slowly being defined as these procedures become more common and more widely available. One of the areas of greatest concern is the use of laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for the surgical treatment of patients with primary colorectal cancer. There are anecdotal reports in the literature describing both port site recurrence and wound recurrence in patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for colorectal cancer. This raises concerns about whether these recurrences are more common in patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures and whether overall survival is compromised. Wound recurrences and laparoscopic port site recurrences have been described with numerous other intra-abdominal tumors, but the precise incidence remains unknown. The authors reviewed data from 39 patients to determine early patterns of recurrence and overall survival. Two-hundred thirty-eight laparoscopic-assisted colectomies were performed by the Norfolk Surgical Group between June 1992 and September 1995. Thirty-nine of the patients who underwent resection for colorectal cancer between June 1992 and September 1993 currently are available for at least a 2-year follow-up. Preoperative evaluation included physical examination, liver function studies, carcinoembryonic antigen, chest x-ray, computed tomography scans, and endoscopies with biopsy. Postoperative follow-up data consisted of physical examination, liver function tests, CEA, chest X-ray, computed tomography scan of the abdomen, and endoscopy of the colon. No patients have been lost to follow-up. Survival rates and patterns of recurrence were compared between node-negative and node-positive patients and compared with conventional data after open surgery. There were 22 men and 17 women ranging in age from 33 to 89 years. Mean follow-up was 30 months, with a range of 24 to 40 months. There were three patients with recurrence and nine deaths. Recurrence and tumor-related death rates, respectively, for each Dukes' stage were 0/1 and 0/1 for stage A, 0/7 and 0/7 for stage B-1, 1/16 and 2/16 for stage B-2, 0/1 and 0/1 for stage C-1, and 2/8 and 1/8 for Stage C-2. All six patients with Dukes' stage D disease died of metastatic colorectal cancer within 4 to 14 months of surgery. There were two patients with anastomotic recurrence. No unusual patterns of recurrent disease were noted, and there were no wound or port site recurrences. In this group of patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies for primary colorectal malignancy, no adverse patterns of recurrence or decreased survival has been noted at 2-year follow-up when compared with standard open colorectal cancer surgery statistics. Prospective randomized studies with long-term follow-up will be required to better define the potential benefits and adverse effects of laparoscopic surgery for colorectal malignancy.A systematic approach toward the analysis of drug-DNA interactions using Raman spectroscopy: the binding of metal-free bleomycins A(2) and B(2) to calf thymus DNA. Bleomycins A(2) and B(2) are the two active components in the antineoplastic drug Blenoxane. DNA is targeted by this drug in cancer cells and the mode of action of this drug involves DNA. Ambiguity exists as to the way in which bleomycin binds to DNA. Raman spectroscopy was used to examine both calf thymus DNA and a bleomycin/DNA complex at two temperatures. A curvefitting technique was applied to these spectra for a spectral region obscured by many overlapping bands associated with the nucleotide bases in order to derive information about frequencies, bandwidths, and intensities of the vibrational modes in this region. This allowed identification and analysis of bands associated with specific assigned nucleotide base residues. Upon binding of bleomycin, several significant changes in bandwidth, intensities, and frequencies relative to uncomplexed DNA were observed consistently at both higher (30 degrees C) and lower (19 degrees C) temperature. The data presented here support at least a partial mode bleomycin that is temperature dependent and more pronounced at the more physiologically relevant temperature of 30 degrees C.A high performance liquid chromatography system for quantification of hydroxyl radical formation by determination of dihydroxy benzoic acids. The hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase enzyme system is known to produce the superoxide ion and hydrogen peroxide during the hydroxylation of hypoxanthine via xanthine to uric acid. When chelated iron is included in this system, superoxide reduces iron (III) to iron(II) and the iron(II)-chelate further reacts with hydrogen peroxide to form the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Because of the limitations of colourimetric and spectrophotometric techniques by which, to date, the mechanisms of hydroxyl radical formation in the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system have been monitored, a high performance liquid chromatography method utilizing the ion-pair reagent tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and salicylic acid as an aromatic probe for quantification of hydroxyl radical formation was set up. In the hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system the major products of hydroxyl radical attack on salicylic acid were 2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid and 2,3-dihydroxy benzoic acid in the approximate ratio of 5:1. That the hydroxyl radical is involved in the hydroxylation of salicylic acid in this system was demonstrated by the potency especially of dimethyl sulphoxide, butanol and ethanol as scavengers. Phytic acid, which is considered to be an important protective dietary constituent against colorectal cancer, inhibited hydroxylation of salicylic acid at a concentration one order of magnitude lower than the classical scavengers, but was only effective in the absence of EDTA. The method has been applied to the study of free radical generation in faeces, and preliminary results indicate that the faecal flora are able to produce reactive oxygen species in abundance.Cutaneous cryosurgery. Cutaneous cryosurgery refers to localized application of freezing temperatures to achieve destruction of skin lesions. It can be used to treat a broad range of benign and premalignant skin conditions, and certain malignant skin conditions, with high cure rates. Cellular destruction is accomplished by delivery of the cryogen via dipstick, probe, or spray techniques. It is widely used in primary care because of its safety, effectiveness, low cost, ease of use, good cosmetic results, and lack of need for anesthesia. Cryosurgery is as effective as alternative therapies for most cases of molluscum contagiosum, dermatofibromas, keloids, and plantar or genital warts. It is a more effective cure for common warts than salicylic acid or observation. Cryosurgery is generally the treatment of choice for actinic keratosis. Contraindications to cryosurgery include cryofibrinogenemia, cryoglobulinemia, Raynaud disease, agammaglobulinemia, and multiple myeloma. Complications from cryosurgery include hypopigmentation and alopecia, and can be avoided by limiting freeze times to less than 30 seconds. Referral to a dermatologist should be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or for treatment of skin cancer, which requires larger amounts of tissue destruction, resulting in higher complication rates.Cross-linked, biodegradable, cytocompatible salicylic acid based polyesters for localized, sustained delivery of salicylic acid: an in vitro study. In order to suppress chronic inflammation while supporting cell proliferation, there has been a continuous surge toward development of polymers with the intention of delivering anti-inflammatory molecules in a sustained manner. In the above backdrop, we report the synthesis of a novel, stable, cross-linked polyester with salicylic acid (SA) incorporated in the polymeric backbone and propose a simple synthesis route by melt condensation. The as-synthesized polymer was hydrophobic with a glass transition temperature of 1 √å√¢√•¬°C, which increases to 17 √å√¢√•¬°C upon curing. The combination of NMR and FT-IR spectral techniques established the ester linkages in the as-synthesized SA-based polyester. The pH-dependent degradation rate and the rate of release of salicylic acid from the as-synthesized SA-based polymer were studied at physiological conditions in vitro. The polyester underwent surface erosion and exhibited linear degradation kinetics in which a change in degradation rate is observed after 4-10 days and 24% mass loss was recorded after 4 months at 37 √å√¢√•¬°C and pH 7.4. The delivery of salicylic acid also showed a similar change in slopes, with a sustained release rate of 3.5% in 4 months. The cytocompatibility studies of these polyesters were carried out with C2C12 murine myoblast cells using techniques like MTT assay and flow cytometry. Our results strongly suggest that SA-based polyester supports cell proliferation for 3 days in culture and do not cause cell death (<7%), as quantified by propidium iodide (PI) stained cells. Hence, these polyesters can be used as implant materials for localized, sustained delivery of salicylic acid and have applications in adjuvant cancer therapy, chronic wound healing, and as an alternative to commercially available polymers like poly(lactic acid) and poly(glycolic acid) or their copolymers.Treatment of advanced solid tumors with NSAIDs: Correlation of quantitative monitoring of circulating tumor cells and positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging. The detection and characterisation of tumor-derived circulating epithelial tumor cells (CETCs) or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been a main focus of basic oncological research over previous years. Numerous studies in the past decade have shown that CTCs are a promising tool for the estimation of the risk for metastatic relapse. The present observational study describes treatment results using tumor imaging and the quantification of CTCs. A group of 14 patients with advanced carcinomas was followed during their anticancer treatments. CTC numbers were serially detected and treatment success was estimated by positron emission tomography-computed tomography. A connection was found between tumor remission and a decreasing CTC count in 83%, a connection between stable disease and stable CTC numbers in 78% and a connection between progressive disease (PD) and an increase in CTC count in 50% of cases. In the patients with PD, an incomplete response was observed affecting the CTCs, but not the solid region of the tumor. As a result of this study, it may be concluded that patients with solid tumors benefit from serial quantification of CTCs in addition to imaging, as this combination of techniques provides a more sensitive result than imaging aloneTobacco use, occupation, coffee, various nutrients, and bladder cancer. In a Canadian population-based case-control study of 480 males and 152 female case-control pairs, the relative risk for development of bladder cancer for ever used versus never used cigarettes was 3.9 for males and 2.4 for females, with a dose-response relationship in both sexes. A reduced risk was associated with the use of filter cigarettes compared to nonfilter cigarettes. After control for cigarette usage, a significant risk was noted for male pipe smokers. For male ex-smokers the risk after 15 years of no smoking was less than one-half that of current male smokers. Bladder cancer risk was found for workers in the chemical, rubber, photographic, petroleum, medical, and food processing industries among males and for workers occupationally exposed to dust or fumes among both sexes. Bladder cancer risk was elevated for males consuming all types of coffee, regular coffee, and instant coffee and for females consuming instant coffee, but no dose-response relationship was found. Risk was found for males consuming water from nonpublic supples but not for females. No risk was observed in males or females consuming nitrate-containing foods, beverages other than coffee, or fiddlehead greens. Hair dye usage in females and phenacetin usage in males and females carried no risk. Divergent findings by area for aspirin suggested that an overall association was not causal. Reevaluation of the data on artificial sweeteners confirmed a significant bladder cancer risk in males and a dose-response relationship. The cumulated population attributable risk for bladder cancer was 90% for males from cigarette smoking, industrial exposure, and exposure to nonpublic water supplies and 29% for females from cigarette smoking, industrial exposure, and instant coffee consumption.Testing a New Anticoagulation Method for Free Flap Reconstruction of Head and Neck Cancers. Free flaps are widely used to reconstruct head and neck defects. Despite the improvement in the surgical techniques and the surgeons' experiences, flap failures still occur due to thrombotic occlusion after small vessels anastomosis. To reduce the possibility of flap loss as a result of thrombotic occlusion, various anticoagulants have been used. In this study we decided to evaluate a new protocol for anticoagulation therapy and its effect on flap survival and complications. In this interventional study, 30 patients with head and neck cancer underwent surgical defects were reconstructed by microvascular free flap between 2013 and 2014. In the postoperative period patients have taken aspirin (100 mg/day) for 5 days and enoxaparin (40 mg/day subcutaneously) for 3 days. The flap survival was followed for three weeks. Given that there was no complete necrosis or loss of flap, the free flap success rate was as much as 100%. The need for re-exploration occurred in 3 patients (10%). Only in one patient the need for re-exploration was due to problem in venous blood flow. The aspirin-enoxaparin short-term protocol may be a good choice after free flap transfer in reconstruction of head and neck surgical defects.A Review of Patents on Therapeutic Potential and Delivery of Hydroge n Sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with a characteristic smell of rotten eggs. Once only thought of as a toxic gas, evidence now shows that H2S plays major roles in pathological and physiological activities. These roles are being utilized to treat diseases and disorders ranging from hypertension, inflammation, edema, cardiovascular issues, chronic pain, cancer, and many more. Challenges facing the use of H2S currently involve achieving the optimum therapeutic concentrations, synthesizing chemically and physiologically stable donors, and developing clinically appropriate delivery systems. We did an extensive literature search on therapeutic potentials and related issues of H2S which were presented in a systematic flow pattern in introduction. Patents accepted/filed on various aspects of hydrogen sulfide were searched using the United States Patent and Trademark Office database at http://patft.uspto.gov/ and google patents at https://patents.google.com/. The important search terms combined with H2S were therapeutic effect, pharmacological action, biochemistry, measurement, and delivery. We also incorporated our own experiences and publications while discussing the delivery approaches and associated challenges. In the process, researchers have discovered novel techniques in preparing the noxious gas by discovering and synthesizing H2S donors and developing controlled and predictable delivery systems. Donors utilized thus far include derivatives of anti-inflammatory drugs like H2S -aspirin, Allium sativum extracts, inorganic salts, phosphorodithioate derivatives, and thioaminoacid derivatives. Use of controlled delivery systems for H2S is critical to maintain its physiological stability, optimum therapeutic window, increase patient compliance, and make it easier to manufacture and administer. Numerous patents overcoming the challenges of using H2S therapeutically with various donors and delivery mechanisms have been reviewed. The scientific knowledge gained from the last decade researches has moved H2S from a foul smelling pungent gas to the status of a gasotransmitter with many potential therapeutic applications. However, developing a suitable donor and a delivery system using that donor for providing precise and sustained release of H2S for an extended period, is critically needed for any further development towards its translation into clinical practices.Identification of low oxygen-tolerating bacteria in prostate secretions of cancer patients and discussion of possible aetiological significance. The microaerophylic organism Propionibacterium acnes has shown consistent association with prostate cancer (PC). Studies linking circumcision with reduced PC further support anaerobes involvement as circumcision reduces anaerobe colonisation on the glans penis. A 1988 study linked anaerobes with PC but considered them as opportunists in necrotic tumor. A hypothesis that a Helicobacter-like process causes PC justified this pilot study. Active surveillance patients were enrolled. Post-prostate massage urine samples were screened using the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) technique for bacterial identification after culture in anaerobic and aerobic conditions. 8 out√å√¢√•√äof 18 patients (41%) had either obligate anaerobic (n√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°=√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°5) or microaerophilic (n√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°=√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°4, one of whom also had anaerobes) organisms identified. None of 10 control samples contained obligate anaerobes. Although mean PSA was 63% higher in those with low oxygen tolerating bacteria, two high outliers resulted in this difference being non-significant. Given the substantially higher proportion of PC patients with organisms growing in a low concentration of oxygen when combined with previous studies compared to controls, the degree of significance was as high as smoking 5-9 cigarettes a day and needs further investigation. Translational research in trials combining Vitamin D and aspirin have begun as part of such investigation.Flavonoids: not just for cancer anymore. Increasingly, veterinary clients are using nutraceuticals as adjuvant treatment for a variety of ailments in their pets. Recent evidence suggests that more than 50% of clients who have companion animals with cancer are using a nutraceutical and/or supplement as part of the treatment plan, and 65% of these clients say their veterinarian approves. This trend does not extend to healthy pets, of which only 10% receive routine supplements. Unfortunately, few resources regarding the safety of nutraceutical use exist, and recent evidence has shown that doses of human-formulated supplements such as lipoic acid can be toxic to cats. Veterinarians need a better understanding of the metabolism and safe upper limits for commonly used nutraceuticals because many clients are giving these products to their pets, often in human formulations. This article focuses primarily on two flavonoids: epigallocathechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), a flavanol, and genistein, an isoflavone.On the affinity and specificity of quercetin for DNA. The potential of quercetin (QUE), being a member of the whole family of structurally different flavonoids, to serve as an anti-tumor agent has been recognized, but not fully understood. The interactions between DNA and a series of the flavonoids have so far been mainly investigated using a variety of experimental techniques. Herein, the specificity of QUE for DNA is explored using sophisticated density functional theory (DFT) methods employed to generate the optimized structure of QUE in complex with adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and cytosine (C), respectively. As far as a preference of QUE is concerned, structural and energetic as well as NMR chemical shift arguments clearly indicate a highest for G and a lowest for C. This observation is further substantiated by analyzing the binding modes of QUE docked in a quadruplex receptor structure of DNA and in a duplex receptor structure of DNA. Among all possible single point mutations of the DNA quadruplex and duplex residues, several critical ones causing a conspicuous stabilizing effect on the original complexes of QUE with the DNA receptors are identified. Consequently, several fundamental standpoints shedding new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between QUE and DNA are discussed.STUDIES ON A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT METHOD FOR LARGE-SCALE PREPARATION OF GENKWANIN FROM DAPHNE GENKWA SIEB. ET ZUCC. USING NORMAL-PHASE FLASH CHROMATOGRAPHY. Genkwanin, a flavonoid which has anti-oxidant and anti-tumor activities, was isolated and purified from flowers of Daphne genkwa Sieb. et Zucc. in a large-scale by normal-phase flash chromatography (NPFC). Dried flower buds were extracted with methanol at room temperature and concentrated. The residues were suspended in water and first extracted with petroleum ether, and then chloroform. Genkwanin was concentrated in the chloroform and insoluble fractions. Under the target-guidance of thin layer chromatography (TLC) as well as solubility, a solvent system composed of cyclohexane-acetone (22:3, v/v) was selected. At a flow rate of 30 mL/min,the insoluble and chloroform fractions were separated to yield 1.5 g and 1.35 g of genkwanin with high purities of 98.3% and 98.6% by HPLC analysis, respectively. The chemical structure of the compound was identified by ESI-MS and NMR. Results of the present study indicated that NPFC was a large preparative-scale, speedy and simple process separation technology and it was feasible to find the appropriate proportion of solvent system by transformation from TLC condition.Transnasal PEG tube placement in patients with head and neck cancer. Head and neck cancer (HNCa) patients have an increased risk of malnutrition and dysphagia because of their malignancy and the adverse events of therapy. Most of these patients require gastrostomies. Four percent to 7% of HNCa patients are unable to undergo per oral percutaneous gastrostomies. Transnasal endoscopy is an option for gastrostomy placement in selected patients. Clinical, epidemiologic characteristics and outcomes of transnasal PEG (t-PEG) placement. Retrospective analysis. Tertiary care hospital, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. All patients who underwent t-PEG placement. Epidemiology, adverse events, and outcomes of t-PEG placement. Sixteen patients underwent t-PEG placement from January 2010 to May 2013. All patients had HNCa and 56.3% had metastasis. Indications for the transnasal approach were airway compromise, malignant oropharyngeal obstruction, and trismus, among others. All procedures were successful using a 20F gastrostomy tube, push technique, anesthesiologist-guided propofol sedation, and/or nasotracheal intubation. Of all patients, 68.8% were white and 68.8% were men. Mean age was 54 years, and mean body mass index was 20.87. Two patients had a total of 2 adverse events: poor wound healing and wound site infection. Of all patients, 18.75% had leukopenia, 6.25% neutropenia, and 50% lymphopenia. Mean white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count were 8.6 √å√Ñ¬â√õ√ì 10(9)/L, 6.57 √å√Ñ¬â√õ√ì 10(9)/L, and .93 √å√Ñ¬â√õ√ì 10(9)/L, respectively. Eleven patients were alive, 2 were lost to follow-up, and 3 had died at the time of review. Retrospective analysis, small cohort, patient selection bias. t-PEG placement is a viable and safe option for HNCa patients when the standard endoscopic approach is not feasible.Awake craniotomy for tumor resection. Surgical treatment of brain tumors, especially those located in the eloquent areas such as anterior temporal, frontal lobes, language, memory areas, and near the motor cortex causes high risk of eloquent impairment. Awake craniotomy displays major rule for maximum resection of the tumor with minimum functional impairment of the Central Nervous System. These case reports discuss the use of awake craniotomy during the brain surgery in Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. A 56-year-old woman with left-sided body hypoesthesia since last 3 months and a 25-year-old with severe headache of 1 month duration were operated under craniotomy for brain tumors resection. An awake craniotomy was planned to allow maximum tumor intraoperative testing for resection and neurologic morbidity avoidance. The method of anesthesia should offer sufficient analgesia, hemodynamic stability, sedation, respiratory function, and also awake and cooperative patient for different neurological test. Airway management is the most important part of anesthesia during awake craniotomy. Tumor surgery with awake craniotomy is a safe technique that allows maximal resection of lesions in close relationship to eloquent cortex and has a low risk of neurological deficit. Nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery using regional anesthesia and vagal block and targeted sedation. Thoracoscopic surgery without endotracheal intubation is a novel technique for diagnosis and treatment of thoracic diseases. This study reported the experience of nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan. From August 2009 through August 2013, 446 consecutive patients with lung or pleural diseases were treated by nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery. Regional anesthesia was achieved by thoracic epidural anesthesia or internal intercostal blockade. Targeted sedation was performed with propofol infusion to achieve a bispectral index value between 40 and 60. The demographic data and clinical outcomes were evaluated by retrospective chart review. Thoracic epidural anesthesia was used in 290 patients (65.0%) while internal intercostal blockade was used in 156 patients (35.0%). The final diagnosis were primary lung cancer in 263 patients (59.0%), metastatic lung cancer in 38 (8.5%), benign lung tumor in 140 (31.4%), and pneumothorax in 5 (1.1%). The median anesthetic induction time was 30 minutes by thoracic epidural anesthesia and was 10 minutes by internal intercostal blockade. The operative procedures included lobectomy in 189 patients (42.4%), wedge resection in 229 (51.3%), and segmentectomy in 28 (6.3%). Sixteen patients (3.6%) required conversion to tracheal intubation because of significant mediastinal movement (seven patients), persistent hypoxemia (two patients), dense pleural adhesions (two patients), ineffective epidural anesthesia (two patients), bleeding (two patients), and tachypnea (one patient). One patient (0.4%) was converted to thoracotomy because of bleeding. No mortality was noted in our patients. Nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery is technically feasible and safe and can be a less invasive alternative for diagnosis and treatment of thoracic diseases.Anesthesia for awake craniotomy: case report. Some intracranial procedures are achievable with patients awake, however, there are challenges ranging from patient compliance to homeostasis. The aim of this study is to present a case of intracranial surgery for removal of a tumor in the left parietal lobe with the patient awake during the procedure. After patient selection and psychological preparation, the proposed excision of the left parietal lobe lesion in the waking state was clarified and accepted. Continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil was administered to maintain a Ramsay score of 2-3. The bilateral scalp blockade was performed with ropivacaine. The Mayfield head fixation device was installed and drapes adjusted to maintain the airway and eyes accessible for mapping with electrical stimulation and tumor excision. For dura mater incision, a pad with 2% lidocaine was applied for 3 minutes. The surgery was uneventful. The patient was discharged on the seventh day of hospitalization without presenting complication. Although the maintenance of analgesia and hemodynamic stability was a challenge with the patient awake, the target-controlled infusion of propofol provided the desired level of consciousness, remifentanil titrated analgesia and sedation without drug accumulation, and the blockade with ropivacaine provided satisfactory analgesia. We conclude that the anesthetic technique was satisfactory for our patient.Anaesthetics and analgesics neurocognitive effects, organ protection and cancer reoccurrence an update. Available general and local anaesthetics, third generation inhaled anaesthetics, propofol and amide class local anaesthetics are effective and reassuringly safe. They are all associated to low incidence of toxicology and or adverse-effects. There is however a debate whether anaesthetic drug and technique could exhibit effects beyond the primary effects fully reversible depression of the central nervous system, dose dependent anaesthesia. Anaesthetics may be involved in the progression of neurocognitive side effects seen especially in the elderly after major surgery, so called Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction. On the other hand anaesthetics may exhibit organ protective potential, reducing ischemia reperfusion injury and improving survival after cardiac surgery. Anaesthetics and anaesthetic technique may also have effects of cancer reoccurrence and risk for metastasis. The present paper provides an update around the evidence base around anaesthesia potential contributing effect on the occurrence of postoperative cognitive adverse-effects, organ protective properties and influence on cancer re-occurrence/metastasis.Anesthetic technique and cancer recurrence in oncologic surgery: unraveling the puzzle. Surgery/anesthetic technique-stimulated immunosuppression in the perioperative period might cause an increase in cancer-related mortality. Whether anesthetic technique can affect the outcomes of cancer patients remains inconclusive. This review discusses data from the available literature on anesthetic techniques applied in oncologic surgery, the long-term outcomes of anesthetic technique, and their relation to survival and cancer recurrence. Searches of the PubMed database up to June 30, 2016, were conducted to identify publications with the terms anesthetic technique and cancer recurrence, regional anesthesia and cancer recurrence, local anesthesia and cancer recurrence, anesthetic technique and immunosuppression, and anesthetic technique and oncologic surgery. Surgery/anesthesia-stimulated activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) provides immunosuppression through several soluble factors. Volatile anesthetics and opioids suppress cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and promote the proliferation of cancer cells and angiogenesis, whereas propofol does not suppress CMI and inhibits tumor angiogenesis. Regional anesthesia (RA) protects CMI and diminishes the surgical neuroendocrine stress response by blocking afferent neural transmission that stimulates the HPA axis and SNS, decreasing the requirement for opioids and volatile anesthetics and thereby decreasing cancer recurrence. Preclinical and retrospective studies highlight a potential benefit of anesthetic technique in reducing cancer-related mortality and recurrence by attenuating immunosuppression following surgical treatment in patients with specific types of cancer. Several well-planned, prospective, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are underway that may provide more conclusive and definitive results regarding the benefits of anesthetic technique on survival in oncologic surgery.Perioperative Anesthesia Care and Tumor Progression. This narrative review discusses the most recent up-to-date findings focused on the currently available best clinical practice regarding perioperative anesthesia care bundle factors and their effect on tumor progression. The main objective is to critically appraise the current literature on local anesthetics, regional outcome studies, opioids, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and their ability to decrease recurrence in patients undergoing cancer surgery. A brief discussion of additional topical perioperative factors relevant to the anesthesiologist including volatile and intravenous anesthetics, perioperative stress and anxiety, nutrition, and immune stimulation is included. The results of several recently published systematic reviews looking at the association between cancer recurrences and regional anesthesia have yielded inconclusive data and provide insufficient evidence regarding a definitive benefit of regional anesthesia. Basic science data suggests an anti tumor effect induced by local anesthetics. New refined animal models show that opioids can safely be used for perioperative pain management. Preliminary evidence suggests that NSAIDs should be an essential part of multimodal analgesia. Volatile anesthetics have been shown to increase tumor formation, whereas preclinical and emerging clinical data from propofol indicate tumor protective qualities. The perioperative period in the cancer patient represents a unique environment where surgically mediated stress response leads to immune suppression. Regional anesthesia techniques when indicated in combination with multimodal analgesia that include NSAIDs, opioids, and local anesthetics to prevent the pathophysiologic effects of pain and neuroendocrine stress response should be viewed as an essential part of balanced anesthesia.Manual Trans-Tracheal High Frequency Positive Pressure Ventilation for Left Main Bronchus and Carinal Mass Surgical Resection in a Child. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), also called pseudo-tumor, is a very rare condition and accounts for less than 1% of primary lung tumor. It is most common benign tumor of lung in children. This case is reported with the objective of highlighting the role of manual trans-tracheal high frequency positive pressure ventilation (HFPPV) in facilitating surgical resection with maintenance of adequate oxygenation and a little compromised ventilation. A9-year boy, weighing 21 kg, was diagnosed as a case of IMTof left main bronchus on biopsy and was successfully treated by surgical excision through left thoracotomy. HFPPV through improvised technique was used for ventilation and oxygenation during surgery. Total Intravenous anaesthesia with propofol infusion and increments of fentanyl was used during HFPPV. After the completion of the surgery, conventional positive pressure ventilation (PPV) was continued through the endotracheal tube (ETT) to check any bronchial stump leak. After the surgery, patient was weaned and extubated in the operating room. Hospital course remained uneventful and the patient was discharged after 6 days. HFPPV with manually improvised technique is applicable in carinal surgery for optimization of oxygenation, ventilation, and uninterrupted surgical resection.Use of a job-exposure matrix to evaluate parental occupation and childhood cancer. We examined the association between parental occupation and childhood cancer among 252 incident cases of childhood cancer (ages 0-14, diagnosed 1976-83) and 222 controls selected by random digit dialing in Denver, Colorado (USA). A job-exposure matrix was used to assign parental exposures based on job titles, emphasizing chemicals that were implicated in previous studies. All cancers, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and brain cancer were examined in relation to parental occupation during the year prior to the birth of the child. Elevated odds ratios (OR), all with confidence intervals extending below the null, were found for maternal exposure to benzene (OR = 1.9), petroleum/coke pitch/tar (OR = 2.2), and soot (OR = 3.3) in relation to total cancers. The ORs for total cancer and paternal exposure to all hydrocarbons combined was 1.0. Results for individual hydrocarbons and ALL showed larger odds ratios, including aniline (OR = 2.1), benzene (OR = 1.6), and petroleum/coke pitch/tar (OR = 1.6). Potential exposure to creosote was strongly associated with brain cancer (OR = 3.7) based on five exposed cases (95 percent confidence interval = 0.8-16.6). Control for other potential childhood cancer risk factors did not alter the results substantially. In spite of uncertainties due to small numbers and errors in exposure classification, results tend to corroborate past research that suggests an association between specific parental occupational exposures and childhood cancer.Mutagens in contaminated soil: a review. The intentional and accidental discharges of toxic pollutants into the lithosphere results in soil contamination. In some cases (e.g., wood preserving wastes, coal-tar, airborne combustion by-products), the contaminated soil constitutes a genotoxic hazard. This work is a comprehensive review of published information on soil mutagenicity. In total, 1312 assessments of genotoxic activity from 118 works were examined. The majority of the assessments (37.6%) employed the Salmonella mutagenicity test with strains TA98 and/or TA100. An additional 37.6% of the assessments employed a variety of plant species (e.g., Tradescantia clone 4430, Vicia faba, Zea mays, Allium cepa) to assess mutagenic activity. The compiled data on Salmonella mutagenicity indicates significant differences (p<0.0001) in mean potency (revertents per gram dry weight) between industrial, urban, and rural/agricultural sites. Additional analyses showed significant empirical relationships between S9-activated TA98 mutagenicity and soil polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentration (r2=0.19 to 0.25, p<0.0001), and between direct-acting TA98 mutagenicity and soil dinitropyrene (DNP) concentration (r2=0.87, p<0.0001). The plant assay data revealed excellent response ranges and significant differences between heavily contaminated, industrial, rural/agricultural, and reference sites, for the anaphase aberration in Allium cepa (direct soil contact) and the waxy locus mutation assay in Zea mays (direct soil contact). The Tradescantia assays appeared to be less responsive, particularly for exposures to aqueous soil leachates. Additional data analyses showed empirical relationships between anaphase aberrations in Allium, or mutations in Arabidopsis, and the 137Cs contamination of soils. Induction of micronuclei in Tradescantia is significantly related to the soil concentration of several metals (e.g., Sb, Cu, Cr, As, Pb, Cd, Ni, Zn). Review of published remediation exercises showed effective removal of genotoxic petrochemical wastes within one year. Remediation of more refractory genotoxic material (e.g., explosives, creosote) frequently showed increases in mutagenic hazard that remained for extended periods. Despite substantial contamination and mutagenic hazards, the risk of adverse effect (e.g., mutation, cancer) in humans or terrestrial biota is difficult to quantify.Separation procedures for naturally occurring antioxidant phytochemicals. Phytochemicals in fruits, vegetables, spices and traditional herbal medicinal plants have been found to play protective roles against many human chronic diseases including cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). These diseases are associated with oxidative stresses caused by excess free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. Antioxidant phytochemicals exert their effect by neutralizing these highly reactive radicals. Among the tens of thousands of phytochemicals found in our diets or traditional medicines, polyphenols and carotenoids stand out as the two most important groups of natural antioxidants. However, although collectively these phytochemicals are good antioxidants, the roles and effect of individual compounds are often not well known. Hundreds of carotenoids and thousands of polyphenols have been identified so far from various plants. A single plant could contain highly complex profiles of these compounds, which sometimes are labile to heat, air and light, and they may exist at very low concentrations in the plants. This makes the separation and detection of these antioxidant phytochemicals a challenging task. The present review focuses on the antioxidant activity, chemical types, sampling and sample processing procedures, and separation using various chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques. Detection and quantification using ultraviolet-visible-diode array and mass spectrometry will be discussed.MHC-B haplotypes impact susceptibility and resistance to RSV-A infection. We investigated the impact of√å√¢√•√ähaplotype√•√äof√•√ämajor histocompatibility complex√•√ä(MHC)-B on the outcome of infection of Synthetic Dam Line (SDL) broiler strain with√•√äRous Sarcoma Virus√å√¢√•√ä(RSV).√å√¢√•√äGenomic√•√äanalysis of√•√äMHC-B√•√ähaplotypes, revealed a total of 12 known standard√•√ähaplotypes√•√äthat constituted to twenty-five different√•√ägenotypes√•√äand one new√•√ähaplotype√•√äof 217 bp size, designated BX. The inoculation of√•√äRSV-A in SDL chicks resulted in the development of√•√ätumors√•√äof progressive or regressive√å√¢√•√äphenotypes√•√äwith varying√•√ätumor profile index√•√ä(TPI).√å√¢√•√äHaplotypes√•√äB2, B21√•√äand B22had low√å√¢√•√äTPI√å√¢√•√äscores (1 or 2) with less√•√ämortality√•√äand were resistant to√å√¢√•√äRSV-A√å√¢√•√ätumor. The√•√ähaplotypes√•√äB13, B13.1., B15, B15.1.√å√¢√•√äand B15.2.√å√¢√•√ähad significantly higher√å√¢√•√äTPI√å√¢√•√äscores (5 or 6), indicating a susceptibility to√•√äRSV-A. The√å√¢√•√ägenotype, Bx√•√ä/Bx, had a mean√•√äTPI√•√äscore of 3.67 √å√¢√•¬± 1.33, which was closer to the resistant√•√ähaplotype.√å√¢√•√äSequence analysis√•√äof the new√•√ähaplotype√•√ä(BX) revealed 99.5% similarity with B2√•√ähaplotype.√•√äMetastases√•√äwas observed in 44% of chicks and comprised of mixed fibrosarcoma and myxosarcoma.Dual TNFalpha-induced effects on NRF2 mediated antioxidant defence in astrocyte-rich cultures: role of protein kinase activation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) is a pleiotropic molecule that can have both protective and detrimental effects in neurodegeneration. Here we have investigated the temporal effects of TNFalpha on the inducible Nrf2 system in astrocyte-rich cultures by determination of glutathione (GSH) levels, gammaglutamylcysteine ligase (gammaGCL) activity, the protein levels of Nrf2, Keap1, the catalytic and modulatory subunit of gammaGCL (gammaGCL-C and gammaGCL-M respectively). Astrocyte-rich cultures were exposed for 24 or 72 h to different concentrations of TNFalpha. Acute exposure (24 h) of astrocyte-rich cultures to 10 ng/mL of TNFalpha increased GSH, gammaGCL activity, the protein levels of gammaGCL-M, gammaGCL-C and Nrf2 in parallel with decreased levels of Keap1. Antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-mediated transcription was blocked by inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK and Akt whereas inactivation of p38 and GSK3beta further enhanced transcription. In contrast treatment with TNFalpha for 72 h decreased components of the Nrf2 system in parallel with an increase of Keap1. Stimulation of the Nrf2 system by tBHQ was intact after 24 h but blocked after 72 h treatment with TNFalpha. This down-regulation after 72 h correlated with activation of p38 MAPK and GSK3beta, since inhibition of these signalling pathways reversed this effect. The upregulation of the Nrf2 system by TNFalpha (24 h treatment) protected the cells from oxidative stress through elevated gammaGCL activity whereas the down-regulation (72 h treatment) caused pronounced oxidative toxicity. One of the important implications of the results is that in a situation where Nrf2 is decreased, such as in Alzheimer's disease, the effect of TNFalpha is detrimental.Enrichment and isolation of barbigerone from Millettia pachycarpa Benth. using high-speed counter-current chromatography and preparative HPLC. Enrichment of the anti-tumor compound barbigerone along with a rotenoid derivative from Millettia pachycarpa Benth. was performed by a two-step high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) separation process. In the first step, 155.8 mg of target fraction (Fra6) was obtained from 400 mg ethyl acetate extract of M. pachycarpa Benth. with an increase in barbigerone from 5.1 to 13% via HSCCC using a solvent system of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (5:4:5:3, v/v) under normal phase head to tail elution. HSCCC was repeated to eliminate the major contaminant in this initial fraction 6. After a separation time of 65 min, 22.1 mg barbigerone of 87.7% purity was obtained from Fra6 with the ternary solvent system of n-hexane-methanol-water (2:2:1, v/v) under normal phase elution. Finally, preparative HPLC was employed for the further isolation of barbigerone and the rotenoid derivative. The structures were confirmed by ESI-MS, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR.Economic consequences of HIV/AIDS in India. HIV/AIDS is one of the pressing public health problems in India. Available information indicates a rising trend of infection. The impact of HIV/AIDS on the economic front is important as it affects mainly the young, who are in the reproductive age group. We estimated the cost of productivity losses in a lifetime attributable to HIV-related mortality in India in the population of the year 1991 at current HIV infection rates. The analysis was done from the societal viewpoint, adopting a discount rate of 5%. To estimate the loss in person-years due to HIV/AIDS, two scenarios were considered. Firstly, the population without HIV/AIDS, and secondly, the population with HIV/AIDS. The difference in person-years lived by the cohort in both populations would provide the person-years lost due to HIV/AIDS. To calculate the person-years lived in each, the life table approach was used. The demographic data from the 1991 Census were used. The population was divided into 15 five-year cohorts and the current age-specific death rates were used. Assumptions regarding HIV incidence rates in urban and rural areas in different age groups were made based on the available data and consensus of experts. The estimate was first done for a cohort of 100,000 population for rural and urban areas and then extrapolated to the population in the different age groups. To convert the person-years lost into monetary terms, minimum wages were estimated to be Rs 14,460 per annum. The total undiscounted life-years lost due to HIV/ AIDS by the present population of India will be 238.4 million years-123.7 million years for urban and 114.7 million years for rural areas. On an average this is 0.4 years lost per person. The life-years lost per case of HIV was 44.4 years. Assuming minimum wages of Rs 14460 as the value of one year, the total economic loss is Rs 3447 billion. The productivity loss per case is Rs 642,024 (US$ 20,710). For an estimated national per capita income of Rs 4252.4 the total economic loss is Rs 1014 billion. If a discount rate of 5% is applied for future losses then the total potential years of life lost will be 23 million-11.3 million for urban and 11.7 million for rural areas. In monetary terms this will be Rs 332.6 billion by minimum wages assumption, and 97.8 billion if the national per capita income is assumed to be the cost of one year. HIV/AIDS imposes a significant burden on the economic front. The productivity losses are likely to be an underestimate as the costs of treatment of HIV/AIDS patients, prevention programmes and labour costs have not been taken into account. To decide whether HIV/AIDS needs a high priority int he Indian context, it is necessary to have similar estimates for other important diseases such as tuberculosis and cancer.Colorectal cancer risk, chronic illnesses, operations, and medications: case control results from the Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study. The associations between colorectal cancer risk and several chronic illnesses, operations, and various medications were examined in 715 colorectal cancer cases and 727 age/sex-matched controls in data derived from a large, comprehensive, population-based study of this cancer conducted in Melbourne, Australia. There was a statistically significant deficit among cases of hypertension, heart disease, stroke, chronic chest disease, and chronic arthritis and a statistically significant excess of hemorrhoids among cases, and all of these differences were consistent for both colon and rectal cancer and for both males and females. Although no statistically significant differences were found for other cancers, there were twice as many breast cancers among cases (16) than among controls and also there were 9 uterine cancers among cases and only 2 among controls. There was a statistically significant deficit among cases in the use of aspirin-containing medication and vitamin supplements, and this was consistent for both colon and rectal cancer and for both males and females. There was a statistically significant excess of large bowel polypectomy among cases. The modeling of these significant associations simultaneously in a logistic regression equation indicated that hypertension, heart disease, chronic arthritis, and aspirin use were each independent effects and consistent for both colon and rectal cancer for both males and females and also that these effects were independent of dietary risk factors previously described in the Melbourne study. The possible relevance of these findings towards an understanding of colorectal cancer risk and etiology is discussed.Racial differences in preventive practices of African-American and Hispanic women. To compare the use of preventive practices of Hispanic- and African-American women aged 50 and older. A cross-sectional survey. Inpatient and outpatient units of a teaching hospital located in South Central Los Angeles. Convenience sample of 337 women aged 50 and older. Demographic and lifestyle characteristics and selected preventive practices. Preventive practices reported were self-breast examination, mammography, Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, digital rectal examination and stool occult blood examination, sigmoidoscopy, chemoprophylaxis, and immunization. Information was obtained in a face-to-face interview. African-American women were more likely to have had a Pap smear ever and to have used aspirin prophylaxis than Hispanic women. There were no major differences in the use of preventive services by the two ethnic groups except for Pap smear and aspirin use. Immunization and colorectal cancer screening rates were low in African-American and Hispanic women.A prospective study of sugar intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in women. To investigate prospectively whether intake of total or type of sugar is associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The contribution of sugar intake to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes has not been settled in the context of primary prevention because of limited prospective data. The Women's Health Study is a randomized controlled trial of aspirin and vitamin E in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer. A validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was completed by 39,345 women aged 45 years and older. The main outcome was the incidence of type 2 diabetes. The predictor was sugar intake, including sucrose, glucose, fructose, and lactose. Using Cox proportional hazard models, multivariate RRs of type 2 diabetes for increasing quintiles of sugar intake compared with the lowest quintile were estimated. Compared with the lowest quintile of sugar intake, the RRs and 95% CIs for the highest quintiles were 0.84 (0.67-1.04) for sucrose, 0.96 (0.78-1.19) for fructose, 1.04 (0.85-1.28) for glucose, and 0.99 (0.80-1.22) for lactose, after adjustment for known risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Similar findings of no association were obtained in subgroup analyses stratified by BMI. Intake of sugars does not appear to play a deleterious role in primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. These prospective data support the recent American Diabetes Association's guideline that a moderate amount of sugar can be incorporated in a healthy diet.A quantitative illustration of the public health potential of aspirin. Aspirin is showing potential in reducing the risk of several diseases of public health importance. These include cardiovascular disease, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, a fictional scenario is considered in which 50 year old individuals are encouraged to take aspirin. Using crude assumptions and simple calculations, a Kaplan-Meier survival curve of aspirin users is presented. The main finding of this exercise is the possibility that the long-term use of low dose aspirin may double the chances of individuals living a healthy life into their 90's. Further research is needed.What role today for Helicobacter pylori in peptic ulcer?. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/aspirin (NSAIDs) remain today the main etiologies of duodenal (DU) and gastric (GU) ulcers. In some countries or areas in which prevalence of H. pylori infection has decreased, and probably also in which the consumption of NSAIDs is high, the proportion of ulcers not associated with H. pylori is high. Nevertheless, the proportion of Helicobacter pylori-negative, NSAID-negative ulcers remains low, less than 6% in most studies. Furthermore, this proportion is probably overestimated because the search for the infection and NSAIDs treatments was not always performed properly. Data about characteristics of idiopathic GU (after excluding cancer) are missing. In two studies, Helicobacter pylori-negative, NSAID-negative DU were associated in two thirds to three quarters of the cases with co-morbidities, often severe (cirrhosis, respiratory, renal or cardiac failure, malignancy). Numerous digestive diseases can give a DU, Crohn's disease being probably the most frequent one. Gastric acid hypersecretion, as in H. pylori-positive DU, seems to be the pathogenic factor of idiopathic DU, with increased duodenal acid load. The outcome of idiopathic ulcers has been little studied. There are no reliable data concerning the risk of complications. Therapy is based on proton pump inhibitors at a dosage allowing prolonged healingAssociation between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and the incidence of lung cancer in the Iowa women's health study. Previous studies have suggested that use of aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with reduced risk of lung cancer, but the data are inconsistent and are limited particularly with respect to the effects of aspirin, separate from other NSAIDs. The Iowa Women's Health Study is a prospective cohort of 41,836 Iowa women ages 55 to 69 years old at baseline in 1986. NSAID use was assessed in 1992. Over 10 years of follow-up, 403 incident cases of lung cancer were identified. The association of incident lung cancer with current use of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs was analyzed after adjustment for lung cancer risk factors. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using multivariate COX proportional hazards regression. There were 27,162 women in the analytic cohort. After controlling for age, education, alcohol intake, pack-years, smoking status, body mass index, and total fruit intake, the RR of women taking six or more aspirin weekly was 1.21 (95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.59). The HR was 1.23 for women taking six or more non-aspirin NSAIDs weekly (95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.65). There was no statistically significant trend by frequency of use for either aspirin (P(trend) = 0.22) or non-aspirin NSAIDs (P(trend) = 0.53). Analyses by histologic type and smoking status yielded similar null results. Information on dosage and duration of use were not available for this analysis. These findings do not suggest that aspirin or other NSAIDs reduce risk of lung cancer in this cohort of postmenopausal women.A quantitative immunochemical fecal occult blood test for colorectal neoplasia. Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) for colorectal cancer screening are not specific for human hemoglobin and have low sensitivity. Automated-development, immunochemical FOBT is quality-controlled, is specific for human hemoglobin, and does not require diet restriction. To measure the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative immunochemical fecal hemoglobin measurements for detection of cancer and advanced adenoma in patients undergoing colonoscopy, to determine fecal hemoglobin thresholds that give the highest posttest probability for neoplasia, and to determine the number of immunochemical FOBTs needed. Prospective, cross-sectional study. Ambulatory endoscopy services of the main health medical organization in Tel Aviv, Israel. 1000 consecutive ambulatory patients--some asymptomatic but at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia and some symptomatic--who were undergoing elective colonoscopy and volunteered to prepare immunochemical FOBTs. The hemoglobin content of 3 bowel movements was measured, and the highest value was compared with colonoscopy findings. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, likelihood ratios, and 95% CIs of fecal hemoglobin measurements for clinically significant neoplasia, their relationship to the amount of fecal hemoglobin measured, and the number of immunochemical FOBTs performed. Colonoscopy identified clinically significant neoplasia in 91 patients (cancer in 17 patients and advanced adenomas in 74 patients). Using 3 immunochemical FOBTs and a hemoglobin threshold of 75 ng/mL of buffer, sensitivity and specificity were 94.1% (95% CI, 82.9% to 100.0%) and 87.5% (CI, 85.4% to 89.6%), respectively, for cancer and 67% (CI, 57.4% to 76.7%) and 91.4% (CI, 89.6% to 93.2%), respectively, for any clinically significant neoplasia. The fecal sampling method is standardized, but the sample size depends on fecal consistency. Some patients were tested while discontinuing aspirin and anticoagulant therapies. Study patients were at increased risk, and results might not apply to average-risk populations. Quantitative immunochemical FOBT has good sensitivity and specificity for detection of clinically significant neoplasia. Test performance in screening average-risk populations is not known.Clinical impact of drug-drug interaction between aspirin and prednisolone at a cancer center. Adverse gastrointestinal (GI) events are complications in aspirin and prednisolone cotherapy. The prevalence of adverse GI events would be expected to be increased with cotherapy due to the overlapping toxicities of the 2 drugs. However, there is a dearth of literature investigating how often this interaction causes clinically important adverse GI events. This retrospective study aimed to determine the prevalence of adverse GI events associated with the coadministration of aspirin and prednisolone. The use of gastroprotectant agents was also studied. The medical records of patients with cancer prescribed aspirin and prednisolone therapy between January 2007 and June 2011 were analyzed. The duration of aspirin-prednisolone overlap, prevalence of adverse GI events, and details on the concurrent use of other medications were evaluated. The study included data from 142 patients (male, 64.8% mean [SD] age, 67.4 [11.0] years). A total of 78.9% of the patients were on some form of gastroprotectant, the most common class of which was proton pump inhibitors. The prevalence of adverse GI events was 4.2% (6 patients). Four patients had presented with GI symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysphagia, and vomiting) 3 patients had signs of GI injury (duodenal ulcers, iron deficiency anemia, and a Mallory-Weiss tear). The Naranjo algorithm classified 5 patients experienced possible adverse drug reactions (ADRs), and 1 as a probable ADR. Our study found that the prevalence of adverse GI events was low and managed to establish a weak association between the occurrence of events and the coadministration of aspirin and prednisolone. This finding, together with the concurrent prescription of gastroprotectants, suggests that the clinical impact of the aspirin and prednisolone DDI is minimal.International clinical practice guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer. √å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ?Guidelines addressing the management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients are heterogeneous and their implementation has been suboptimal worldwide. To establish a common international consensus addressing practical, clinically relevant questions in this setting. An international consensus working group of experts was set up to develop guidelines according to an evidence-based medicine approach, using the GRADE system. For the initial treatment of established VTE: low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is recommended [1B] fondaparinux and unfractionated heparin (UFH) can be also used [2D] thrombolysis may only be considered on a case-by-case basis [Best clinical practice (Guidance)] vena cava filters (VCF) may be considered if contraindication to anticoagulation or pulmonary embolism recurrence under optimal anticoagulation periodic reassessment of contraindications to anticoagulation is recommended and anticoagulation should be resumed when safe VCF are not recommended for primary VTE prophylaxis in cancer patients [Guidance]. For the early maintenance (10 days to 3 months) and long-term (beyond 3 months) treatment of established VTE, LMWH for a minimum of 3 months is preferred over vitamin K antagonists (VKA) [1A] idraparinux is not recommended [2C] after 3-6 months, LMWH or VKA continuation should be based on individual evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, tolerability, patient preference and cancer activity [Guidance]. For the treatment of VTE recurrence in cancer patients under anticoagulation, three options can be considered: (i) switch from VKA to LMWH when treated with VKA (ii) increase in LMWH dose when treated with LMWH, and (iii) VCF insertion [Guidance]. For the prophylaxis of postoperative VTE in surgical cancer patients, use of LMWH o.d. or low dose of UFH t.i.d. is recommended pharmacological prophylaxis should be started 12-2 h preoperatively and continued for at least 7-10 days there are no data allowing conclusion that one type of LMWH is superior to another [1A] there is no evidence to support fondaparinux as an alternative to LMWH [2C] use of the highest prophylactic dose of LMWH is recommended [1A] extended prophylaxis (4 weeks) after major laparotomy may be indicated in cancer patients with a high risk of VTE and low risk of bleeding [2B] the use of LMWH for VTE prevention in cancer patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery may be recommended as for laparotomy [Guidance] mechanical methods are not recommended as monotherapy except when pharmacological methods are contraindicated [2C]. For the prophylaxis of VTE in hospitalized medical patients with cancer and reduced mobility, we recommend prophylaxis with LMWH, UFH or fondaparinux [1B] for children and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with l-asparaginase, depending on local policy and patient characteristics, prophylaxis may be considered in some patients [Guidance] in patients receiving chemotherapy, prophylaxis is not recommended routinely [1B] primary pharmacological prophylaxis of VTE may be indicated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic [1B] or lung [2B] cancer treated with chemotherapy and having a low risk of bleeding in patients treated with thalidomide or lenalidomide combined with steroids and/or chemotherapy, VTE prophylaxis is recommended in this setting, VKA at low or therapeutic doses, LMWH at prophylactic doses and low-dose aspirin have shown similar effects however, the efficacy of these regimens remains unclear [2C]. Special situations include brain tumors, severe renal failure (CrCl<30 mL min(-1) ), thrombocytopenia and pregnancy. Guidances are provided in these contexts. Dissemination and implementation of good clinical practice for the management of VTE, the second cause of death in cancer patients, is a major public health priority.Improved survival outcomes with the incidental use of beta-blockers among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy. Preclinical studies have shown that norepinephrine can directly stimulate tumor cell migration and that this effect is mediated by the beta-adrenergic receptor. We retrospectively reviewed 722 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received definitive radiotherapy (RT). A Cox proportional hazard model was utilized to determine the association between beta-blocker intake and locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). In univariate analysis, patients taking beta-blockers (n = 155) had improved DMFS (P < 0.01), DFS (P < 0.01), and OS (P = 0.01), but not LRPFS (P = 0.33) compared with patients not taking beta-blockers (n = 567). In multivariate analysis, beta-blocker intake was associated with a significantly better DMFS [hazard ratio (HR), 0.67 P = 0.01], DFS (HR, 0.74 P = 0.02), and OS (HR, 0.78 P = 0.02) with adjustment for age, Karnofsky performance score, stage, histology type, concurrent chemotherapy, radiation dose, gross tumor volume, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the use of aspirin. There was no association of beta-blocker use with LRPFS (HR = 0.91, P = 0.63). Beta-blocker use is associated with improved DMFS, DFS, and OS in this large cohort of NSCLC patients. Future prospective trials can validate these retrospective findings and determine whether the length and timing of beta-blocker use influence survival outcomes.Thyroid cancer risk is not increased in diabetic patients. This study evaluated thyroid cancer risk with regards to diabetes status and diabetes duration, and with the use of anti-diabetic drugs including sulfonylurea, metformin, insulin, acarbose, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, by using a population-based reimbursement database in Taiwan. A random sample of 1,000,000 subjects covered by the National Health Insurance was recruited. After excluding patients with type 1 diabetes, 999730 subjects (495673 men and 504057 women) were recruited into the analyses. Logistic regression estimated the odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for independent variables including age, sex, diabetes status/duration, anti-diabetic drugs, other medications, comorbidities, living regions, occupation and examinations that might potentially lead to the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in various models. The diabetic patients had a significantly higher probability of receiving potential detection examinations (6.38% vs. 5.83%, P<0.0001). After multivariable-adjustment, the OR (95% CI) for diabetes status was 0.816 (0.652-1.021) and for diabetes duration <1 year, 1-3 years, 3-5 years and √å¬¢¬â√õ¬°√•¬¥ 5 years vs. non-diabetes was 0.071 (0.010-0.507), 0.450 (0.250-0.813), 0.374 (0.203-0.689) and 1.159 (0.914-1.470), respectively. Among the anti-diabetic agents, only sulfonylurea was significantly associated with thyroid cancer, OR (95% CI): 1.882 (1.202-2.947). The OR (95% CI) for insulin, metformin, acarbose, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone was 1.701 (0.860-3.364), 0.696 (0.419-1.155), 0.581 (0.202-1.674), 0.522 (0.069-3.926) and 0.669 (0.230-1.948), respectively. Furthermore, patients with benign thyroid disease or other cancer, living in Kao-Ping/Eastern regions, or receiving potential detection examinations might have a significantly higher risk and male sex, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, vascular complications or use of statin, aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs might be associated with a significantly lower risk. There is a lack of an overall association between diabetes and thyroid cancer, but patients with diabetes duration <5 years have a significantly lower risk. Sulfonylurea may increase the risk of thyroid cancer.Unclassified pleomorphic and spindle cell pulmonary neoplasm with brain metastases after prasugrel. There was an excess of new solid neoplasms (112 vs. 69), and cancer deaths (24 vs. 15) after prasugrel in the TRITON (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition). These cancers usually occur after 4 months following prasugrel, and women are especially at risk. The hypothesis has been offered that prasugrel, but not aspirin or clopidogrel, causes indirect modulation of tumor growth, and/or enhanced metastatic dissemination due to instability of platelet-tumor cell aggregates via the inability to keep cancer locally within the platelet thrombi due to excessive chronic platelet inhibition. A 70-year old female diabetic patient underwent drug-eluting stent implantation. The patient received a loading dose of prasugrel (60 mg), followed by prasugrel 10 mg/daily as well as aspirin (81 mg/daily). After 4 months on dual antiplatelet therapy she expectorated blood when coughing. A lung X-ray and CT scan revealed numerous lung nodules later diagnosed as unclassified pleomorphic and spindle cell malignant solid neoplasm. The patient died following multiple brain metastasis. Female gender, duration of prasugrel exposure, rare unclassified neoplasm pathology type and a tumor of a highly metastatic and aggressive nature in the index patient should be regarded with caution. The effects of novel antiplatelet agents on the onset of cancer should be tested in future mega-trials.The associations between bullous pemphigoid and drug use: a UK case-control study. To explore associations between bullous pemphigoid (BP) and previous drug use in the United Kingdom. A case-control study comparing the drug history of consecutive patients with BP and control subjects. Tertiary care center for immunobullous diseases and skin tumor clinics at Oxford University Hospitals. Eighty-six consecutive BP patients and 134 consecutive controls from the same region and similar in age and sex who presented with other dermatological diagnoses. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence interval of BP in relation to each drug. Loop diuretics were used significantly more frequently by the BP patients (crude odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.2-5.0 P= .02] adjusted odds ratio, 3.8 [1.5-9.7 P= .006]). No significant differences were found between groups for use of other diuretics, aspirin, antidepressants, antiepileptics, antihypertensives, or central nervous system agents (eg, antipsychotics). Patients with BP used calcium or vitamin D supplements, antibiotics, antihistamines, and prednisolone significantly more often on multivariate analysis. The findings of our study demonstrate increased use of loop diuretics in patients with BP before the development of BP. The mechanism behind such an association clearly warrants further investigation.Non-intubated, uniportal, video assisted thoracic surgery VATS] lobectomy, as a new procedure in our department]. Due to the emerging experience in VATS (video assisted thoracic surgery) lobectomies, in some centers the so called non-intubated VATS lobectomies (NITS - non-intubated thoracic surgery) gained increased authority, during which endotracheal intubation and muscle relaxation of the patient is not carried out, thus surgery is being performed with the patient breathing spontaneously. The recent study deals with our initial experience gained during uniportal NITS VATS lobectomies. Between 24.01.2017 and 10.03.2017, 16 patients (female: 8 male: 8) with lung cancer underwent NITS VATS uniportal lobectomy. Mean age was 59.6 years (42-73 years). Mean FEV1 was 87.7% (62-109). Mean BMI was 27.1 (18.8-32.8). Prior to surgery, the patients received benzodiazepine premedication, local anesthetic (Lidocaine) for incision and Bupivacaine for intercostal and vagus nerve blockage. Besides routine monitoring Bispectoral Index (BIS) guided target-controlled infusion (TCI) Propofol sedation was carried out, with the help of laryngeal mask anesthesia. Skin and soft tissue incision was performed at the fifth intercostal space, in the axillary line. This single incision sight was the only one needed for the introduction of the camera, together with the instruments needed for dissection and resection of the lobe and placement of the chest tube. Complete atelectasis can develop. The following lobes were removed: 7 right upper lobes, 2 mid-lobes, 1 right lower lobe, 1 right lower lobe + right upper lobe wedge resection, 5 left lower lobes. After the resections, extended mediastinal sampling or block dissection was performed. There was no perioperative mortality. Conversion to endotracheal intubation was needed in non of the cases. Mean operative time was 96,5 minutes (80-120 min.), mean drainage periode was 2.9 days (2-8 days). Prolonged air leak was 1/16 (6.25%). Postoperative fever occurred in 1 patient and subcutaneous emphysema in 1 case, and 1 pneumonia. Because of a recurrent pneumothorax, a re-drainage was necessary in 1 case. Pathology of the resected lobes were as follows: 1 endobronchial hamartochondroma causing complete atelectasis of the lobe, 1 chronic pneumonia, and 10 adenocarcinomas, 2 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 carcinosarcoma, and 1 typical carcinoid. Staging of the 14 malignant cases were as follows: 8 IA, 2 IB, 1 IIA, 2 IIB, and 1 IIIA. The average number of the removed mediastinal lymph nodes is 12 (7-20). Non-intubated (NITS) VATS lobectomy is considered a safe procedure, satisfying all aspects of oncological guidelines. The postoperative drainage period was shorter caused by the complete atelectasis during the surgery.Intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine promotes postoperative sleep and recovery following radical mastectomy under general anesthesia. Postoperative sleep disturbance and fatigue following radical mastectomy were high risks for prolonged convalescence in patients with breast cancer. The present study was designed to observe the effect of intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine on postoperative sleep, fatigue and recovery following radical mastectomy under general anesthesia. Forty-seven patients were randomized into two groups that were maintained with propofol/remifentanil/Ringer's solution (Control group), or propofol/remifentanil/Dexmedetomidine (DEX group) for surgery under general anesthesia. During the first night following surgery, patients receiving dexmedetomine spent more time sleeping when compared with those form the Control group. During the first week following operation, when compared with the Control group, patients from the DEX group had a higher score of global 40-item recovery questionnaire on day 3 following operation, and lower 9-question fatigue severity scores on day 3 and day 7 following operation. In conclusion, intraoperative use of dexmedetomidine is sufficient to improve postoperative sleep disorder, promote postoperative recovery. The adverse effect of dexmedetomidine on sleep disturbance might be contributed to its recovery-promoting effect.A case of left frontal high-grade glioma diagnosed during pregnancy. As pregnancy accelerates glioma growth, therapeutic abortion has been recommended prior to tumor resection. Additionally, it has also been suggested that the extent of glioma resection is closely correlated with patient survival. A 162-cm, 61.4-kg, 30-year-old, right-handed primigravida was referred to our institution at 21√å√¢√•√äweeks gestation to obtain a second opinion. At 18√å√¢√•√äweeks gestation, the patient developed new-onset generalized convulsive seizures (GCSs), which were poorly controlled by anticonvulsant polytherapy, early in the second trimester. A 6-cm lesion located in her left frontal supplementary motor area (SMA) was suspected as a grade III glioma, classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Due to the limited evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy during pregnancy, tumors causing neurological symptoms and seizures must be treated, in order to stabilize the maternal condition and enable a safe birth. In the case of pregnant patients, awake craniotomy using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) is considered advantageous, achieving gross total resection with a reduction of direct cortical stimulation, which may induce seizure, and so reducing fetal exposure to anesthetics. The Asleep-Awake-Asleep technique was performed at 27√å√¢√•√äweeks and 2√å√¢√•√ädays gestation. As use of propofol in pregnant patients is prohibited, general anesthesia was maintained through administration of sevoflurane and remifentanil until the first scan of iMRI, and was subsequently re-induced with dexmedetomidine when tumor removal had been accomplished. A supraglottic airway (SGA) was used until the patient's cranium was opened. There were no complications during either the procedure or the post-operative period. At 35√å√¢√•√äweeks gestation, the patient delivered a healthy baby of 2317√å√¢√•√äg. Pathological examination of the patient, revealed an anaplastic astrocytoma, thus radiotherapy and chemotherapy began 2√å√¢√•√ämonths post-delivery. There is no evidence of tumor recurrence in the patient and the child did not show any medical or developmental concerns at the point of the 17-month follow-up. Since evidence on the use of adjuvant therapy during pregnancy is limited, extensive resection with functional monitoring is recommended if a brain tumor is presumed to be malignant. Awake craniotomy is considered advantageous to pregnant patients because subjective movement preserves the patient's motor function and reduces fetal exposure to anesthetics. Therefore, providing multidisciplinary discussion takes place within the decision-making process, as well as careful perioperative preparation, awake craniotomy should be considered, even in the case of pregnant patients.Retrospective cohort mortality study and nested case-control study of workers exposed to creosote at 11 wood-treating plants in the United States. The objective of this study was to assess both malignant and nonmalignant mortality risks of workers exposed to creosote. For background, a literature review is also presented. The retrospective cohort study consisted of 2179 employees at 11 plants in the United States where wood (primarily railroad ties and utility poles) is treated with creosote-based preservatives. The observation period covered 1979-2001. Mortality data in the cohort study were analyzed in terms of cause-specific standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), with expected deaths based on U.S. national cause-, gender-, race-, year-, age-specific mortality rates. In addition to the cohort investigation, a nested case-control study of lung cancer and multiple myeloma was conducted. Information on tobacco consumption and detailed employment (job titles) was obtained for cases and matched controls. Jobs were classified into 5 categories according to potential for exposure to creosote. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated for job categories and length of exposure. Overall mortality for the entire cohort was lower than expected (293 observed deaths vs. 325.37 expected, SMR = 90.1, 95% CI = 80.0-101.0). Close to 90% employees were hourly, whose potential for exposure was generally much higher than that of salaried employees. Among hourly employees, except for multiple myeloma, none of the specific cancer sites showed any significant increase. Furthermore, detailed analysis by length of employment did not reveal any significant mortality excess or upward trend. Six deaths were from multiple myeloma, whereas 1.50 deaths were expected (SMR = 401.1, 95% CI = 147.2-873.1). However, analysis by length of employment did not show any upward trend for multiple myeloma. No significant mortality increase was reported for any nonmalignant disease, and analysis by length of employment did not reveal any upward trend. In the case-control study, an increased risk of lung cancer was associated with tobacco consumption (OR = 4.92) but not with any job/exposure category. For example, the lung cancer odds ratio for routine exposure to creosote-based wood preservatives was 0.58 (95% CI = 0.11-3.03). Similarly, case-control analyses of multiple myeloma did not reveal any association with employment at the plants or with exposure to creosote-based wood preservatives or to creosote-treated products. Based on the present investigation and other studies, there was no evidence that employment at the 11 wood-treating plants or exposure to creosote-based wood preservatives was associated with any significant mortality increase from site-specific cancers or nonmalignant diseases. Some results should be interpreted with caution because they were based on small numbers.Tumor Prevalence in Mummichogs from the Delaware Estuary Watershed. Mummichogs Fundulus heteroclitus were collected in 2002-2004 from six locations within the Delaware Estuary watershed and examined histopathologically. The objective was to compare the prevalence of skin and liver tumors in fish from locations with a range of sediment polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) based on available data. Fish were collected from (1) three locations within the industrialized Christina River subwatershed (Hershey Run, Newport Marsh (upriver and downriver)) (2) one location in the Motiva Enterprises refinery discharge canal to the Delaware River (3) one location in the St. Jones River and (4) one location in Blackbird Creek. Adult mummichogs (√å¬¢¬â√õ¬°√•¬¥70 mm n = 21-30 fish per location) were seined and held for necropsy. No neoplastic skin lesions were diagnosed in any fish. No liver tumors were diagnosed in the St. Jones, Motiva, Newport Marsh upriver, or Newport Marsh downriver collections. One of 30 Blackbird Creek mummichogs had foci of hepatocellular alteration (a putative preneoplastic lesion) and one had hepatocellular carcinoma. There was a significant difference in hepatocellular carcinoma prevalence in Hershey Run mummichogs in 2002 (9 of 21 fish, or 43%) and in 2003 (3 of 29 fish, or 10%) compared with all other locations pooled (1 of 145 fish, or 0.7%). Hershey Run is contaminated with creosote from an adjacent Superfund site, where sediments were frequently reported to have total PAH concentrations greater than 100 mg of total PAH/kg and a maximum of 13,300 mg/kg. No other locations had reports of total PAHs higher than 11 mg/kg. In conclusion, liver neoplasia was associated with exposure to sediment containing high concentrations of PAHs derived from creosote. Studies that include tumor prevalence, biomarkers (e.g., DNA adducts and PAH metabolites in bile), and sediment and/or tissue chemistry are recommended to develop a weight of evidence for specific chemical classes.Time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay of plasma and urine O-desmethylangolensin. We present a method for the determination of the phytoestrogen metabolite O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) in plasma (serum) and in urine. O-DMA is a metabolite of daidzein, which occurs in soybeans. It has been suggested that isoflavones may afford protection against breast and prostate cancer and therefore, also the metabolites are of interest. The method is based on time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA) using a europium chelate as a label. After the synthesis of 4-O-carboxymethyl-O-DMA, this compound is coupled to bovine serum albumin, and then used as antigen in immunization of rabbits. The tracers with the europium chelate are synthesized using the same 4-O-derivative of the alpha-methyldeoxybenzoin. After enzymatic hydrolysis and ether extraction the immunoassay is carried out by time resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA). Cross-reactivity was tested with angolensin, dihydrogenistein, dihydrodaidzein, equol, 6'-OH-angolensin, trans-4-OH-equol, 6'-OH-O-DMA, cis-4-OH-equol and 5-OH-equol. The antiserum cross-reacted only with angolensin. This cross-reactivity seems not to influence the results, which were highly specific. Plasma samples are hydrolyzed and extracted. Urine samples are analyzed directly after hydrolysis without extraction. The correlation coefficient between the plasma TR-FIA results and the GC-MS results was high r value was 0.985. The correlation coefficient between the urine TR-FIA results and the GC-MS results was high over the entire range of concentrations (0-1500 nmol/l) r value was 0.976, but lower in the low concentration range (0-100 nmol/l), i.e. value was 0.631. The intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) for plasma O-DMA concentrations and for urine O-DMA concentrations at three different concentrations varied 2.8-7.7 and 3.0-6.0%, respectively and the inter-assay CVs varied 3.8-8.9 and 4.4-6.6%, respectively. The working range of the plasma and urine O-DMA assays was 0.5-512 nmol/l.In vitro incubation of human feces with daidzein and antibiotics suggests interindividual differences in the bacteria responsible for equol production. Daidzein can be metabolized to equol, dihydrodaidzein (DHD), and O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) by intestinal bacteria. Only one third to one half of individuals produce equol, and evidence exists to support potential cancer-protective effects of equol production. We investigated the in vitro metabolism of daidzein by fecal bacteria and assessed the effect of several antibiotics on metabolism. Fresh or previously frozen feces from 7 equol producers and 6 nonproducers were incubated with daidzein, with or without antibiotics, for 5 d at 37 degrees C. With the exception of one previously frozen sample, fecal inoculates from equol producers converted daidzein to equol. Conversion occurred under anaerobic, but not aerobic conditions. Fecal inoculates from equol nonproducers did not produce equol, but some produced ODMA and DHD. Between-subject differences in the effects of antibiotics on daidzein metabolism were apparent. Some antibiotics inhibited the production of equol but had no effect on DHD production. These results suggest that several bacteria may be involved in daidzein metabolism, and that they may differ among subjects. This simple in vitro system can facilitate the study of factors influencing equol production and minimize the need for animal models or human interventions. Furthermore, these analyses can be conducted on fecal samples that have been frozen and stored.Mammographic density in relation to daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes in overweight, postmenopausal women. Circulating hormones are associated with mammographic density, an intermediate marker of breast cancer risk. Differences in circulating hormones, including estrone and testosterone, have been observed in premenopausal women based on their capacity to metabolize daidzein, an isoflavone found predominantly in soybeans. Equol and O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) are products of intestinal bacterial metabolism of daidzein. There is interindividual variability in the capacity to produce daidzein metabolites individuals can be equol producers or non-producers and O-DMA producers or non-producers. We tested the hypothesis that daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes are associated with mammographic density. Participants were recruited from among 92 sedentary, postmenopausal women, ages 50 to 75 years, who participated in a 1-year physical activity intervention. Pre-intervention mammographic density was determined using a computer-assisted, gray-scale thresholding technique. Fifty-five of these women consumed supplemental soy protein (>10 mg daidzein/d) for 3 days and collected a first-void urine sample on the fourth day to determine daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes. Equol and O-DMA concentrations were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Associations between daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes and percent mammographic density were adjusted for age, maximum adult weight, gravidity, family history of breast cancer, and serum follicle-stimulating hormone and free testosterone concentrations. Mammographic density was 39% lower in equol producers compared with non-producers (P = 0.04). O-DMA producers had mammographic density 69% greater than non-producers (P = 0.05). These results suggest that particular intestinal bacterial profiles are associated with postmenopausal mammographic density, and these associations are not entirely explained by differences in reproductive or anthropometric characteristics or circulating hormones.Prevalence of daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes differs between Caucasian and Korean American women and girls. Interindividual differences in metabolism of the soy isoflavone, daidzein, to equol and O-desmethylangolensin (ODMA) by human gut bacteria, have been associated with altered risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, according to some studies. Differences have been reported in the prevalence of the equol-producer phenotype among populations, with a higher prevalence in soy-consuming Asian populations than in Western populations. To date, prevalence of the daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes in Asians, compared with Caucasians, has not been evaluated in the context of a standardized phenotyping method. We assessed the prevalence of equol- and ODMA-producer phenotypes in 91 Korean American (KA) women and girls living in the Seattle, Washington area and compared this with previous similarly collected prevalence data in Caucasian American (CA) women and girls (n = 222). We also compared the dietary habits of the 2 groups. Isoflavonoid concentrations in first-void morning urines, collected after a 3-d soy challenge, were used to establish equol-, and ODMA-producer phenotypes (>44 microg/L). The prevalence of the equol-producer phenotype was higher (51 vs. 36% P = 0.015) and the ODMA-producer phenotype was lower (84 vs. 92%, P = 0.03) in KA than in CA women and girls. KAs consumed approximately 3 times more soy foods than the CAs, but no significant associations were found between the consumption of soy foods and equol-producer phenotype. Our findings support the reports that, compared with Western populations, Asian populations have a higher equol-producer prevalence. The additional observation that the prevalence of the ODMA-producer phenotype is lower in KAs suggests that daidzein-metabolizing patterns in general may differ between KAs and CAs.Phytoestrogen exposure, polymorphisms in COMT, CYP19, ESR1, and SHBG genes, and their associations with prostate cancer risk. Prospective phytoestrogen exposure was assessed using both biomarkers and estimates of intake in 89 British men recruited into the Norfolk arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, men who subsequently developed prostate cancer. Results were compared with those from 178 healthy men matched by age and date of recruitment. Levels of seven phytoestrogens (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin, equol, enterodiol, and enterolactone) were measured in spot urine and serum samples. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms in COMT, CYP19, ESR1, and SHBG genes were genotyped. Urinary levels of all phytoestrogens correlated strongly with serum levels. Correlation coefficients ranged from 0.63 (glycitein) to 0.88 (daidzein) (P < 0.001). Urinary and serum levels correlated significantly with isoflavone intake assessed from food diaries (R = 0.15-0.20 P < 0.05) but not with that from a food-frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios for phytoestrogen exposure, as assessed using the four methods, were not significantly associated with prostate cancer risk (P = 0.15-0.94). Men with the CC genotype for the ESRI PvuII polymorphism had significantly higher risk for prostate cancer compared with men with the TT genotype [adjusted odds ratio = 4.65 (1.60-13.49) P = 0.005]. Our results utilizing a combined prospective exposure provide no evidence that phytoestrogens alter prostate cancer risk in British men, whereas the C allele for the PvuII polymorphism may be associated with increased risk.Variations in plasma phytoestrogen concentrations in European adults. Dietary phytoestrogens may play a role in chronic disease occurrence. The aim of our study was to assess the variability of plasma concentrations in European populations. We included 15 geographical regions in 9 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands, and UK) and a 16th region, Oxford, UK, where participants were recruited from among vegans and vegetarians. All subjects were participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Plasma concentrations of 3 isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, and glycitein), 2 metabolites of daidzein [O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA) and equol] and 2 mammalian lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) were measured in 1414 participants. We computed geometric means for each region and used multivariate regression analysis to assess the influence of region, adjusted for gender, age, BMI, alcohol intake, smoking status, and laboratory batch. Many subjects had concentrations below the detection limit [0.1 microg/L (0.4 nmol/L)] for glycitein (80%), O-DMA (73%) and equol (62%). Excluding subjects from Oxford, UK, the highest concentrations of isoflavones were in subjects from the Netherlands and Cambridge, UK [2-6 microg/L (7-24 nmol/L) P < 0.05], whereas concentrations for lignans were highest in Denmark [8 microg/L (27 nmol/L) P < 0.05]. Isoflavones varied 8- to 13-fold, whereas lignans varied 4-fold. In the vegetarian/vegan cohort of Oxford, concentrations of isoflavones were 5-50 times higher than in nonvegetarian regions. Region was the most important determinant of plasma concentrations for all 7 phytoestrogens. Despite the fact that plasma concentrations of phytoestrogens in Europe were low compared with Asian populations, they varied substantially among subjects from the 16 different regions.Daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes in relation to mammographic breast density among premenopausal women in the United States. Mammographic breast density is an established marker of breast cancer risk, and is hormonally sensitive. Studies suggest that production of the daidzein metabolites equol and O-Desmethylangolensin (ODMA) may be associated with hormones and hormonally mediated factors, but few studies have assessed relationships between the capacity to produce these metabolites and breast density. To evaluate the relationship between equol- and ODMA-producer phenotypes and breast density in premenopausal women in the United States. Two hundred and three women attended a clinic visit and 200 provided a urine sample following a 3 day soy challenge. Samples were analyzed for isoflavones by GC-MS to determine daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes. Percent density on recent (87.5 ng/ml urine), respectively. In unadjusted and adjusted analyses, there were no differences in breast density between producers and non-producers of either equol or ODMA (P > 0.05). In this population of low-soy consuming premenopausal women, there were no associations between daidzein-metabolizing phenotypes and breast density, suggesting that these phenotypes per se do not influence premenopausal breast density.Lack of prospective associations between plasma and urinary phytoestrogens and risk of prostate or colorectal cancer in the European Prospective into Cancer-Norfolk study. Dietary phytoestrogens are suggested to reduce the risk of prostate and colorectal cancer, but the results of epidemiologic studies have not yielded consistent support for this proposed effect, possibly due to inadequate databases of phytoestrogen levels in foods. Biomarkers of phytoestrogen intakes may provide a clearer insight into the relationship between phytoestrogen exposure and the risk of prostate or colorectal cancer risks. From the European Prospective into Cancer-Norfolk cohort (ages 45-75), serum and urine samples were analyzed for seven phytoestrogens [daidzein, enterodiol, enterolactone, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), and equol] among 193 cases of prostate cancer and 828 controls, and 221 cases of colorectal cancer with 889 controls. Summary variables of total lignans (enterodiol and enterolactone) and total isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, O-DMA, equol, and glycitein) were created and analyzed in conjunction with individual phytoestrogens. Logistic regression analyses revealed that there was no significant association between prostate cancer risk and total serum isoflavones [odds ratio (OR), 1.01 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.93-1.10] or total serum lignans (OR, 0.94 95% CI, 0.86-1.04) or between colorectal cancer risk and total serum isoflavones (OR, 1.01 95% CI, 0.94-1.08) or total serum lignans (OR, 1.03 95% CI, 0.94-1.12). Similarly, null associations were observed for individual serum phytoestrogens and for all urinary phytoestrogen biomarkers. In conclusion, we have found no evidence to support an inverse association between phytoestrogen exposure and prostate or colorectal cancer risk.Urine accurately reflects circulating isoflavonoids and ascertains compliance during soy intervention. Isoflavonoids (IFL) may protect against chronic diseases, including cancer. IFL exposure is traditionally measured from plasma (PL), but the reliability of urine is uncertain. We assessed whether IFL excretion in overnight urine (OU) or spot urine (SU) reliably reflects IFLs in PL and the usefulness of the three matrices to determine soy intake compliance. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled soy intervention trial with 350 postmenopausal women, IFLs (daidzein, genistein, glycitein, equol, O-desmethylangolensin, dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein) were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in OU, SU, and PL collected at baseline and every 6 months over 2.5 years. High between-subject intraclass correlations between all three matrices (median, 0.94) and high between-subject Pearson correlations (median r(OU-PL) = 0.80 median r(SU-PL) = 0.80 median r(OU-SU) = 0.92) allowed the development of equations to predict IFL values from any of the three matrices. Equations developed from a randomly selected 87% of all available data were valid because high correlations were found on the residual 13% of data between equation-generated and measured IFL values (median r(OU-PL) = 0.86 median r(SU-PL) = 0.78 median r(OU-SU) = 0.84) median absolute IFL differences for OU-PL, SU-PL, and OU-SU were 8.8 nmol/L, 10.3 nmol/L, and 0.28 nmol/mg, respectively. All three matrices showed highly significant IFL differences between the placebo and soy intervention group at study end (P < 0.0001) and highly significant correlations between IFL values and counted soy doses in the intervention group. OU and SU IFL excretion reflect circulating PL IFL levels in healthy postmenopausal women accurately. Noninvasively-collected urine can be used to reliably determine systemic IFL exposure and soy intake compliance.Profiles of phytoestrogens in human urine from several Asian countries. Intake of a diet rich in phytoestrogens has been associated with a decreased risk for hormone-dependent cancers in humans. Biomonitoring of phytoestrogens in human urine has been used to assess the intake of phytoestrogens. Although studies have reported phytoestrogen levels in urine specimens from the United States and Japan, little is known of human intake of phytoestrogens in other Asian countries. In this study we determined the concentrations of seven phytoestrogens, namely, enterolactone, enterodiol, daidzein, equol, O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), genistein, and coumestrol, in 199 human urine samples from three Asian countries, Vietnam (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh), Cambodia (Phnom Penh), and India (Chennai and Kolkata), using a simple, sensitive, and reliable liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) method. The residue levels of phytoestrogens in urine samples from the three Asian countries were compared with the concentrations in 26 urine samples from Japan (Ehime) and 16 urine samples from the United States (Albany), analyzed in this study. Among the phytoestrogens analyzed, isoflavones such as daidzein and genistein were predominant in urine samples from Vietnam samples from Cambodia and India contained higher concentrations of enterolactone than isoflavones. Urinary concentrations of isoflavones in samples from Hanoi, Vietnam, were notably higher than the concentrations in samples from Cambodia, India, and the United States and similar to the concentrations in samples from Japan. The lowest concentrations of daidzein and the highest concentrations of enterolactone were found in urine samples from India. Concentrations of equol and O-DMA, which are microbial transformation products of daidzein (produced by gut microflora), were notably high in urine samples from Hanoi, Vietnam. The ratios of the concentration of equol or O-DMA to that of daidzein were significantly higher in samples from Hanoi than from Japan, indicating high biotransformation efficiency of daidzein by the population in Hanoi. High concentrations of equol, in addition to isoflavones, in urine have been linked to reduced breast cancer risk in previous studies, and, thus, the Vietnamese population may have potential protective effect against breast cancer. This study suggests that the dietary intake and profiles of phytoestrogens vary considerably, even among Asian countries.Correlations of urinary phytoestrogen excretion with lifestyle factors and dietary intakes among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women. Isoflavones and lignans, two major groups of phytoestrogens, have been postulated to have multiple health benefits, including anti-estrogenic, anti-cancer, pro-cardiovascular health, and ameliorating menopausal symptoms. Urinary excretion of isoflavonoids, including daidzein, genistein, glycitein, O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), dihydro-daidzein, dihydrogenistein, and equol, and lignans, including enterodiol and enterolactone, have been used as biomarkers of phytoestrogen exposure in epidemiologic studies. We evaluated the urinary excretion of phytoestrogens and their correlations with lifestyle and dietary factors among 2,165 women who participated in the Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), a population-based prospective cohort study of 74,942 urban Chinese women aged 40-70 years at study enrollment (1996-2000). The medians (in nmol/mg creatinine) were: isoflavonoids, 17.13 daidzein, 5.57 genistein, 2.41 glycitein, 0.94 O-DMA, 1.52 dihydrodaidzein, 0.81 dihydrogenistein, 0.19 equol, 0.11 enterodiol, 0.30 and enterolactone, 1.18. These levels are 2- (enterodiol) to 126- (O-DMA) fold higher than levels among US women similar in age range with the exception of enterolactone, for which a similar level was observed for both populations. Urinary isoflavonoid excretion was higher among older women and women who engaged in regular exercise and significantly associated with soy food intake, but was inversely related to fruit intake. Urinary excretions of dihydrodaidzein, dihydrogenistein, equol, enterodiol, and enterolactone were inversely associated with body mass index (BMI). Urinary excretion of isoflavones correlated with soy food intake and healthy lifestyle but was inversely associated with fruit intake among middle-aged and elderly Chinese women. Our study adds important information to the rapidly growing body of research on the potential health benefits of phytoestrogens.Urinary enterolactone is associated with obesity and metabolic alteration in men in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-10. Phyto-oestrogens are a family of plant-derived xeno-oestrogens that have been shown to prevent cancer in some studies. Whether phyto-oestrogen intake affects obesity status in a population is still unclear. In the present cross-sectional study, we examined the association of urinary phyto-oestrogen metabolites with obesity and metabolic parameters in children and adults. Data from 1294 children (age 6-19 years) and from 3661 adults (age √å¬¢¬â√õ¬°√•¬¥√å√¢√•√ä20 years) who participated in the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-10 were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to investigate the associations of BMI, waist circumference, serum metabolites (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, TAG, fasting glucose and fasting insulin) and the metabolic syndrome with urinary phyto-oestrogen levels. When stratified by age and sex, we found a stronger association (OR 0√å√¢√•√°30, 95√å√¢√•√ä% CI 0√å√¢√•√°17, 0√å√¢√•√°54 P60 years) in the same survey. However, no associations with urinary daidzein, O-desmethylangolensin, equol, enterodiol or genistein were found in the overall population. We also found that the elevation of enterolactone levels was inversely associated with TAG levels, fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin levels and the metabolic syndrome in males aged 20-60 years, but positively associated with HDL-cholesterol levels. The present results provide epidemiological evidence that urinary enterolactone is inversely associated with obesity in adult males.Urinary isoflavonoids and risk of type 2 diabetes: a prospective investigation in US women. To examine the association between urinary excretion of isoflavonoids and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a nested case-control study among 1111 T2D pairs identified during 1995-2008 in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII, who were free of diabetes, CVD and cancer at urine sample collection. Urinary excretion of daidzein and genistein, as well as their metabolites O-desmethylangolensin (O-DMA), dihydrogenistein (DHGE) and dihydrodaidzein (DHDE) was assayed using liquid chromatography MS. Self-reported T2D incident cases were confirmed using a validated questionnaire. Higher urinary excretion of daidzein and genistein was associated with a lower risk of T2D in the combined cohorts. Comparing extreme tertiles of the urinary markers, the OR of T2D were 0√å√¢√•√°71 (95 % CI 0√å√¢√•√°55, 0√å√¢√•√°93) for daidzein and 0√å√¢√•√°74 (95 % CI 0√å√¢√•√°56, 0√å√¢√•√°97) for genistein, although the test for linear trend was not significant for genistein (P trend=0√å√¢√•√°03 and 0√å√¢√•√°15, respectively). DMA, DHDE and DHGE were non-significantly associated with a lower T2D risk. The inverse association of daidzein with T2D risk was stronger among post-menopausal women who did not use hormone replacement therapy (P interaction=0√å√¢√•√°001): the OR was 0√å√¢√•√°58 (95 % CI 0√å√¢√•√°34, 0√å√¢√•√°97) comparing extreme tertiles among these women. In conclusion, urinary excretion of isoflavones was associated with a lower T2D risk in US women, especially among post-menopausal women who did not use hormone. Further research is warranted to replicate these observations among western populations with similarly low overall isoflavone intake.Comparative study on effects of puerarin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in treating acute myocardial infarction. To compare the effects of puerarin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in treating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and on the size of infarcted area and cytokines. Seventy-nine patients with anterior AMI were randomly divided into three groups, they were treated with conventional Western medical treatment, but to the puerarin group (PG) and the G-CSF group (GCG) puerarin and G-CSF was given additionally, respectively. The infarcted size, plasma G-CSF, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected before and after treatment. The infarcted size was positively correlated to the levels of G-CSF, MMP-9, IL-6 and TNF-alpha before treatment ( r = 0.45, 0.42, 0.44 and 0.42, P0.05). Puerarin and G-CSF are effective in decreasing infarcted size, but their effects on cytokines are different entirely.Rapid HPLC analysis of dietary phytoestrogens from legumes and from human urine. Due to growing evidence suggesting that phytoestrogens might protect against various cancers, particularly against breast and prostate cancer, it is important to measure the exposure of populations to these compounds by determining levels in food and in human tissue or body fluids to assess the possible cancer protective properties of these agents. Therefore, we developed a simple and fast procedure to extract and simultaneously hydrolyze phytoestrogens and their conjugates from food items, and present a fast and selective high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for precise determinations of the most common dietary phytoestrogens genistein, biochanin-A, daidzein, formononetin, and coumestrol using flavone as internal standard. For the first time HPLC was applied to measure these phytoestrogens and their most abundant metabolites equol and O-desmethyl-angolensin from human urine. The proposed methodology has been evaluated for losses due to thermal degradation during extraction and hydrolysis and due to sample handling during the entire work-up including solid phase extraction, and values are given for inter- and intra-assay variability. We present isoflavonoid levels of most common peas and beans used in western and eastern diets and compare isoflavonoid and coumestrol levels of raw, canned, and cooked foods which can be used in future epidemiological studies. We also determined human urinary levels with our methodology comparing values before and after soybean intake.In vitro evaluation of Sun Protection Factor and stability of commercial sunscreens using mass spectrometry. Sunlight exposure causes several types of injury to humans, especially on the skin among the most common harmful effects due to ultraviolet (UV) exposure are erythema, pigmentation and lesions in DNA, which may lead to cancer. These long-term effects are minimized with the use of sunscreens, a class of cosmetic products that contains UV filters as the main component in the formulation such molecules can absorb, reflect or diffuse UV rays, and can be used alone or as a combination to broaden the protection on different wavelengths. Currently, worldwide regulatory agencies define which ingredients and what quantities must be used in each country, and enforce companies to conduct tests that confirm the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) and the UVA (Ultraviolet A) factor. Standard SPF determination tests are currently conducted in vivo, using human subjects. In an industrial mindset, apart from economic and ethical reasons, the introduction of an in vitro method emerges as an interesting alternative by reducing risks associated to UV exposure on tests, as well as providing assertive analytical results. The present work aims to describe a novel methodology for SPF determination directly from sunscreen formulations using the previously described cosmetomics platform and mass spectrometry as the analytical methods of choice.Genetic variants and risk of gastric cancer: a pathway analysis of a genome-wide association study. This study aimed to discover candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for hypothesizing significant biological pathways of gastric cancer (GC). We performed an Identify Candidate Causal SNPs and Pathways (ICSNPathway) analysis using a GC genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset, including 472,342 SNPs in 2,240 GC cases and 3,302 controls of Asian ethnicity. By integrating linkage disequilibrium analysis, functional SNP annotation, and pathway-based analysis, seven candidate SNPs, four genes and 12 pathways were selected. The ICSNPathway analysis produced 4 hypothetical mechanisms of GC: (1) rs4745 and rs12904√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°EFNA1√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°ephrin receptor binding (2) rs1801019√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°UMPS√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°drug and pyrimidine metabolism (3) rs364897√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°GBA√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°cyanoamino acid metabolism and (4) rs11187870, rs2274223, and rs3765524√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°PLCE1√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™√å¬¢¬â√¢√Ç¬â√õ¬°lipid biosynthetic process, regulation of cell growth, and cation homeostasis. This pathway analysis using GWAS dataset suggests that the 4 hypothetical biological mechanisms might contribute to GC susceptibility.Short leukocyte telomere length, alone and in combination with smoking, contributes to increased risk of gastric cancer or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. In humans, telomeres shorten along with division of somatic cells. Shortened telomere length might result in genomic instability and has been associated with several malignancies. However, the findings in different populations remain conflicting. Therefore, we assessed the association of telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes with risk of gastric cancer (GC) or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in a Chinese Han population. A total of 574 GC cases, 740 ESCC cases and 774 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included in this analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by logistic regression. The GC or ESCC patients had significantly shorter relative telomere length (RTL) (median √å√¢√•¬± SD: GC: 1.20 √å√¢√•¬± 0.42 ESCC: 1.27 √å√¢√•¬± 0.48) than controls (1.41 √å√¢√•¬± 0.58). Four-fold increased GC risk (OR = 4.10, 95% CI = 2.78-6.05, P = 1.10 √å√Ñ¬â√õ√ì 10-12) or 1.56-fold increased ESCC risk (95% CI = 1.12-2.18, P = 0.009) among subjects in the shortest quartile of telomere length was found compared with the highest quartile. We also observed a cumulative effect between short RTL and smoking in intensifying risk of GC (P = 4.50 √å√Ñ¬â√õ√ì 10-9) or ESCC (P = 5.92 √å√Ñ¬â√õ√ì 10-33). Moreover, there were cumulative effects between RTL, smoking and drinking in elevating risk of GC (Ptrend = 0.001) or ESCC (Ptrend = 1.57 √å√Ñ¬â√õ√ì 10-32). Interestingly, RTL-related rs621559 and rs398652 genetic variants are significantly associated with GC risk. These results indicate that short RTL is involved in susceptibility to developing GC or ESCC, alone and in a gene-environment interaction manner. Short telomere length might be a potential molecular marker, in combination with lifestyle risk factors, to identify high-risk individuals.Determination of liquiritigenin by ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry: Application to a linear pharmacokinetic study of liquiritigenin in rat plasma. A simple, sensitive and rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method has been developed and validated for the quantification of liquiritigenin, a promising anti-tumor agent. Liquiritigenin and the internal standard were separated on an Agilent Extend C18 column and eluted with a gradient mobile phase system of acetonitrile and water. The analysis was performed on a negative ionization electrospray mass spectrometer via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Transitions of m/z 255.0√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™119.0 for liquiritigenin and m/z 269.0√å¬¢¬â√õ√ä¬â√õ¬™117.0 for the IS were monitored. One-step protein precipitation with acetonitrile was used to remove impurities and extract the analytes from plasma. The method had a chromatographic run time of 4.5min and a good linearity in the range of 1-1000ng/mL. The precision (R.S.D.) of intra-day and inter-day ranged from 4.54 to 10.65% and 5.94 to 13.81%, respectively while the accuracy of intra-day and inter-day ranged from 104.06 to 109.28% and 94.98 to 112.05%. The recovery and stability were also within the acceptable limits. The validated method was applied to a linear pharmacokinetic study of liquiritigenin in rat plasma for the first time.Effects of emodin and baicalein on rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To investigate the therapeutic effects of emodin in combination with baicalein on severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) rats and to explore the mechanism of SAP. A total of 112 SAP rats induced by retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the biliary-pancreatic duct, randomly assigned to a untreated group and three treated groups emodin group, combined emodin and baicalein group, and sandostatin group. Meanwhile, another 28 other rats were selected as sham operation (SO) group. There were 28 rats in each group, 8 rats were in 3 and 6 h groups respectively, and 12 rats in 12 h group. At each time-points, survival rates, ascites volumes, pathological lesion scores of pancreas tissues, serum amylase, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6 levels were determined as the indexes of therapeutic effects. The survival rate at 12 h was significantly higher in three treated groups than in untreated group. The ascites volume at 12 h was remarkably less in combined and sandostatin groups than in emodin group, but there was no difference between combined group and sandostatin group (P>0.05). Serum amylase levels at all time-points were significantly lower in three treated groups than in untreated group. However, they had no difference among treated groups (P>0.05). Serum TNF-alpha were lower in three treated groups than in untreated group at all time points. Among the three treated groups, at 6 h, the TNF-alpha levels of combination and sandostatin groups were lower than those of emodin group. These was no difference between combined and sandostantin. Serum IL-6 concentration at 3 h were lower in combined and sandostatin groups than in untreated group, but at 6 and 12 h they were lower in all treated groups than in untreated group and the combined and sandostatin groups and in emodin group, no difference was found between combined and sandostatin groups at all time-points (P>0.05). The pathological scores of pancreas at all time points were significantly lower in three treated groups than in the untreated group, and at 6, 12 h, the scores of combined and sandostatin groups were lower than in emodin group. There was no difference between combined and sandostatin groups (P>0.05). Combination of emodin with baicalein has significant therapeutic effects on SAP rats.Development of a new in vitro skin sensitization assay (Epidermal Sensitization Assay EpiSensA) using reconstructed human epidermis. Recent changes in regulatory requirements and social views on animal testing have accelerated the development of reliable alternative tests for predicting skin sensitizing potential of chemicals. In this study, we aimed to develop a new in vitro skin sensitization assay using reconstructed human epidermis, RhE model, which is expected to have broader applicability domain rather than existing in vitro assays. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of five genes (ATF3, DNAJB4, GCLM, HSPA6 and HSPH1) related to cellular stress response were significantly up-regulated in RhE model after 6h treatment with representative skin sensitizers, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and oxazolone, but not a non-sensitizer, benzalkonium chloride. The predictive performance of five genes was examined with eight skin sensitizers (e.g., cinnamic aldehyde), four non-sensitizers (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate) and four pre-/pro-haptens (e.g., p-phenylenediamine, isoeugenol). When the positive criteria were set to obtain the highest accuracy with the animal testing (LLNA), ATF3, DNAJB4 and GCLM exhibited a high predictive accuracy (100%, 93.8% and 87.5%, respectively). All tested pre-/pro-haptens were correctly predicted by both ATF3 and DNAJB4. These results suggested that the RhE-based assay, termed epidermal sensitization assay (EpiSensA), could be an useful skin sensitization assay with a broad applicability domain including pre-/pro-haptens. Parthenolide accumulation and expression of genes related to parthenolide biosynthesis affected by exogenous application of methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid in Tanacetum parthenium. Up-regulation of germacrene A synthase and down-regulation of parthenolide hydroxylase genes play key role in parthenolide accumulation of feverfew plants treated with methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid. Parthenolide is an important sesquiterpene lactone due to its anti-migraine and anti-cancer properties. Parthenolide amount was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography after foliar application of methyl jasmonate (100√å√¢√•√ä√å√¢√•¬µM) or salicylic acid (1.0√å√¢√•√ämM) on feverfew leaves in time course experiment (3-96√å√¢√•√äh). Results indicate that exogenous application of methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid activated parthenolide biosynthesis. Parthenolide content reached its highest amount at 24√å√¢√•√äh after methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid treatments, which were 3.1- and 1.96-fold higher than control plants, respectively. Parthenolide transiently increased due to methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid treatments until 24√å√¢√•√äh, but did not show significant difference compared with control plants at 48 and 96√å√¢√•√äh time points in both treatments. Also, the transcript levels of early pathway (upstream) genes of terpene biosynthesis including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase and hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase and the biosynthetic genes of parthenolide including germacrene A synthase, germacrene A oxidase, costunolide synthase and parthenolide synthase were increased by methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid treatments, but with different intensity. The transcriptional levels of these genes were higher in methyl jasmonate-treated plants than salicylic acid-treated plants. Parthenolide content measurements along with expression pattern analysis of the aforementioned genes and parthenolide hydroxylase as side branch gene of parthenolide suggest that the expression patterns of early pathway genes were not directly consistent with parthenolide accumulation pattern hence, parthenolide accumulation is probably further modulated by the expression of its biosynthetic genes, especially germacrene A synthase and also its side branch gene, parthenolide hydroxylase.Serum protein profiling by miniaturized solid-phase extraction and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Serum profiling by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) holds promise as a clinical tool for early diagnosis of cancer and other human diseases. Sample preparation is key to achieving reproducible and well-resolved signals in MALDI-MS a prerequisite for translation of MALDI-MS based diagnostic methods to clinical applications. We have investigated a number of MALDI matrices and several miniaturized solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods for serum protein concentration and desalting with the aim of generating reproducible, high-quality protein profiles by MALDI-MS. We developed a simple protocol for serum profiling that combines a matrix mixture of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid with miniaturized SPE and MALDI-MS. Functionalized membrane discs with hydrophobic, ion-exchange or chelating properties allowed reproducible MALDI mass spectra (m/z 1000-12,000) to be obtained from serum. In a proof-of-principle application, SPE with chelating material and MALDI-MS identified protein peaks in serum that had been previously reported for distinguishing a person diagnosed with breast cancer from a control. These preliminary results indicate that this simple SPE/MALDI-MS method for serum profiling provides a versatile and scalable platform for clinical proteomics.A uniform 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid layer as a matrix for MALDI-FTICR MS-based lipidomics. A very uniform 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) layer was for the first time constructed and used as a matrix for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTICR MS) for quickly exploring the changes in lipids within biological systems. Lipid extracts from biological samples were dissolved in chloroform and deposited onto the DHB layer. Benefiting from the insolubility of DHB in chloroform, the uniform matrix crystals were still maintained, and more importantly, the lipid analytes were distributed homogeneously on the layer, which significantly increased the reproducibility of analysis using MALDI-FTICR MS. Taking advantage of the benefit of high resolution of FTICR MS and the fragment ions obtained by MS/MS, lots of lipids were identified. This method was used for exploring the changes of lipids in drug-resistant tumor cells compared with paired drug-sensitive tumor cells. The principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were employed for discovery of the changed lipids. This method, characterized by the simplicity and the speediness, demonstrated a new and promising approach for lipidomics study.Population versus hospital controls in the assessment of dietary intake of isoflavone for case-control studies on cancers in China. To assess dietary isoflavone intake between population and hospital outpatient controls and examine if cancer risks estimated for isoflavone using hospital outpatient controls would be different from those using population controls. Three parallel case-control studies on leukemia, breast, and colorectal cancers in China in 2009-2010 were conducted, using population and hospital outpatient controls to separately match 560 incident cases at a 1:1 ratio. A validated food frequency questionnaire was administered by face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The 2 control groups had closely similar distributions of dietary isoflavone intake. Risk estimates for breast cancers were adjusted ORs (95% CI) of 0.39 (0.23-0.66) and 0.31 (0.18-0.55) for daidzein, 0.35 (0.20-0.61) and 0.28 (0.16-0.52) for genistein, 0.66 (0.41-1.08) and 0.53 (0.32-0.88) for glycitein, and 0.53 (0.33-0.85) and 0.43 (0.26-0.71) for total isoflavone using hospital outpatient and population controls respectively. The study found that hospital outpatient controls were comparable to population controls in measured dietary intake of isoflavone in the Chinese hospital setting.\n"
